It is suitable for use in an introductory\\nprogramming course and for people who are trying to learn pro gramming on their own. There\\nare no prerequisites beyond a general familiarity with the i deas of computers and programs.\\nThere is enough material for a full year of college-level pro gramming. Chapters 1 through 7\\ncan be used as a textbook in a one-semester college-level cou rse or in a year-long high school\\ncourse.\\nThis version of the book covers “Java 5.0”, and many of the exa mples use features that were\\nnot present in earlier versions of Java. (Sometimes, you wil l see this version of Java referred\\nto as Java 1.5 instead of Java 5.0.) Note that Java applets app ear throughout the pages of the\\non-line version of this book. Many of those applets will be no n-functional in W eb browsers that\\ndo not support Java 5.0.\\nThe home web site for this book is http://math.hws.edu/java notes/.

Y ou’ll want to have some idea of what a computer program is and how one is\\ncreated. Since you will be writing programs in the Java progr amming language, you’ll want to\\nknow something about that language in particular and about t he modern, networked computing\\nenvironment for which Java is designed.\\nAs you read this chapter, don’t worry if you can’t understand everything in detail. (In fact,\\nit would be impossible for you to learn all the details from th e brief expositions in this chapter.)\\nConcentrate on learning enough about the big ideas to orient yourself, in preparation for the\\nrest of the book.

But at the\\nheart—or the brain, if you want—of the computer is a single co mponent that does the actual\\ncomputing. This is the Central Processing Unit , or CPU. In a modern desktop computer,\\nthe CPU is a single “chip” on the order of one square inch in siz e. The job of the CPU is to\\nexecute programs.\\nA program is simply a list of unambiguous instructions meant to be foll owed mechanically\\nby a computer. A computer is built to carry out instructions t hat are written in a very simple\\ntype of language called machine language . Each type of computer has its own machine\\nlanguage, and the computer can directly execute a program on ly if the program is expressed in\\nthat language. (It can execute programs written in other lan guages if they are ﬁrst translated\\ninto machine language.)\\nWhen the CPU executes a program, that program is stored in the computer’s main mem-\\nory (also called the RAM or random access memory). In addition to the program, memory\\ncan also hold data that is being used or processed by the progr am. Main memory consists of a\\nsequence of locations. These locations are numbered, and the sequence number of a l ocation\\nis called its address. An address provides a way of picking out one particular piec e of informa-\\ntion from among the millions stored in memory . When the CPU ne eds to access the program\\ninstruction or data in a particular location, it sends the ad dress of that information as a sig-\\nnal to the memory; the memory responds by sending back the dat a contained in the speciﬁed\\n1'),\n",

THE MENT AL LANDSCAPE\\nlocation. The CPU can also store information in memory by spe cifying the information to be\\nstored and the address of the location where it is to be stored .\\nOn the level of machine language, the operation of the CPU is f airly straightforward (al-\\nthough it is very complicated in detail). The CPU executes a p rogram that is stored as a\\nsequence of machine language instructions in main memory . I t does this by repeatedly reading,\\nor fetching, an instruction from memory and then carrying out, or executing, that instruc-\\ntion. This process—fetch an instruction, execute it, fetch another instruction, execute it, and so\\non forever—is called the fetch-and-execute cycle . With one exception, which will be covered\\nin the next section, this is all that the CPU ever does.\\nThe details of the fetch-and-execute cycle are not terribly important, but there are a few\\nbasic things you should know. The CPU contains a few internal registers, which are small\\nmemory units capable of holding a single number or machine la nguage instruction. The CPU\\nuses one of these registers—the program counter , or PC—to keep track of where it is in the\\nprogram it is executing. The PC stores the address of the next instruction that the CPU should\\nexecute. At the beginning of each fetch-and-execute cycle, the CPU checks the PC to see which\\ninstruction it should fetch. During the course of the fetch- and-execute cycle, the number in the\\nPC is updated to indicate the instruction that is to be execut ed in the next cycle. (Usually ,\\nbut not always, this is just the instruction that sequential ly follows the current instruction in\\nthe program.)\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nA computer executes machine language programs mechanicall y—that is without under-\\nstanding them or thinking about them—simply because of the w ay it is physically put together.\\nThis is not an easy concept. A computer is a machine built of mi llions of tiny switches called\\ntransistors, which have the property that they can be wired together in su ch a way that an\\noutput from one switch can turn another switch on or oﬀ. As a co mputer computes, these\\nswitches turn each other on or oﬀ in a pattern determined both by the way they are wired\\ntogether and by the program that the computer is executing.\\nMachine language instructions are expressed as binary numb ers. A binary number is made\\nup of just two possible digits, zero and one. So, a machine lan guage instruction is just a sequence\\nof zeros and ones. Each particular sequence encodes some par ticular instruction. The data that\\nthe computer manipulates is also encoded as binary numbers. A computer can work directly\\nwith binary numbers because switches can readily represent such numbers: T urn the switch on\\nto represent a one; turn it oﬀ to represent a zero. Machine lan guage instructions are stored\\nin memory as patterns of switches turned on or oﬀ. When a machi ne language instruction\\nis loaded into the CPU, all that happens is that certain switc hes are turned on or oﬀ in the\\npattern that encodes that particular instruction. The CPU i s built to respond to this pattern\\nby executing the instruction it encodes; it does this simply because of the way all the other\\nswitches in the CPU are wired together.\\nSo, you should understand this much about how computers work : Main memory holds\\nmachine language programs and data. These are encoded as bin ary numbers. The CPU fetches\\nmachine language instructions from memory one after anothe r and executes them. It does\\nthis mechanically , without thinking about or understandin g what it does—and therefore the\\nprogram it executes must be perfect, complete in all details , and unambiguous because the CPU\\ncan do nothing but execute it exactly as written. Here is a sch ematic view of this ﬁrst-stage\\nunderstanding of the computer:'),\n",

However, the CPU and main memory are only two out of many components in a real\\ncomputer system. A complete system contains other devices s uch as:\\n• A hard disk for storing programs and data ﬁles. (Note that main memory ho lds only a\\ncomparatively small amount of information, and holds it onl y as long as the power is turned\\non. A hard disk is necessary for permanent storage of larger a mounts of information, but\\nprograms have to be loaded from disk into main memory before t hey can actually be\\nexecuted.)\\n• A keyboard and mouse for user input.\\n• A monitor and printer which can be used to display the computer’s output.\\n• A modem that allows the computer to communicate with other computer s over telephone\\nlines.\\n• A network interface that allows the computer to communicate with other computer s\\nthat are connected to it on a network.\\n• A scanner that converts images into coded binary numbers that can be st ored and\\nmanipulated on the computer.\\nThe list of devices is entirely open ended, and computer syst ems are built so that they can\\neasily be expanded by adding new devices. Somehow the CPU has to communicate with and\\ncontrol all these devices. The CPU can only do this by executi ng machine language instructions\\n(which is all it can do, period). The way this works is that for each device in a system, there\\nis a device driver , which consists of software that the CPU executes when it has to deal\\nwith the device. Installing a new device on a system generall y has two steps: plugging the\\ndevice physically into the computer, and installing the dev ice driver software. Without the\\ndevice driver, the actual physical device would be useless, since the CPU would not be able to\\ncommunicate with it.'),\n",

THE MENT AL LANDSCAPE\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nA computer system consisting of many devices is typically or ganized by connecting those\\ndevices to one or more busses. A bus is a set of wires that carry various sorts of informatio n\\nbetween the devices connected to those wires. The wires carr y data, addresses, and control\\nsignals. An address directs the data to a particular device a nd perhaps to a particular register\\nor location within that device. Control signals can be used, for example, by one device to alert\\nanother that data is available for it on the data bus. A fairly simple computer system might\\nbe organized like this:\\nInput/\\nOutput\\nController\\nData bus\\nAddress bus\\nControl bus\\nCPU Empty Slot\\nfor future\\nExpansion\\nKeyboard Network\\nInterface\\n......\\nNetwork Cable\\nVideo\\nController\\nand\\nMonitor\\nMemory\\nNow, devices such as keyboard, mouse, and network interface can produce input that needs\\nto be processed by the CPU. How does the CPU know that the data i s there? One simple idea,\\nwhich turns out to be not very satisfactory , is for the CPU to k eep checking for incoming data\\nover and over. Whenever it ﬁnds data, it processes it. This me thod is called polling , since\\nthe CPU polls the input devices continually to see whether th ey have any input data to report.\\nUnfortunately , although polling is very simple, it is also v ery ineﬃcient. The CPU can waste\\nan awful lot of time just waiting for input.\\nT o avoid this ineﬃciency , interrupts are often used instead of polling. An interrupt is\\na signal sent by another device to the CPU. The CPU responds to an interrupt signal by\\nputting aside whatever it is doing in order to respond to the i nterrupt. Once it has handled\\nthe interrupt, it returns to what it was doing before the inte rrupt occurred. F or example, when\\nyou press a key on your computer keyboard, a keyboard interru pt is sent to the CPU. The\\nCPU responds to this signal by interrupting what it is doing, reading the key that you pressed,\\nprocessing it, and then returning to the task it was performi ng before you pressed the key .\\nAgain, you should understand that this is a purely mechanica l process: A device signals an\\ninterrupt simply by turning on a wire. The CPU is built so that when that wire is turned on,\\nthe CPU saves enough information about what it is currently d oing so that it can return to\\nthe same state later. This information consists of the conte nts of important internal registers\\nsuch as the program counter. Then the CPU jumps to some predet ermined memory location\\nand begins executing the instructions stored there. Those i nstructions make up an interrupt\\nhandler that does the processing necessary to respond to the interru pt. (This interrupt handler\\nis part of the device driver software for the device that sign alled the interrupt.) At the end of'),\n",

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS 5\\nthe interrupt handler is an instruction that tells the CPU to jump back to what it was doing;\\nit does that by restoring its previously saved state.\\nInterrupts allow the CPU to deal with asynchronous events . In the regular fetch-and-\\nexecute cycle, things happen in a predetermined order; ever ything that happens is “synchro-\\nnized” with everything else. Interrupts make it possible fo r the CPU to deal eﬃciently with\\nevents that happen “asynchronously ,” that is, at unpredict able times.\\nAs another example of how interrupts are used, consider what happens when the CPU needs\\nto access data that is stored on the hard disk. The CPU can acce ss data directly only if it is\\nin main memory . Data on the disk has to be copied into memory be fore it can be accessed.\\nUnfortunately , on the scale of speed at which the CPU operate s, the disk drive is extremely\\nslow. When the CPU needs data from the disk, it sends a signal t o the disk drive telling it\\nto locate the data and get it ready . (This signal is sent synch ronously , under the control of a\\nregular program.) Then, instead of just waiting the long and unpredictalble amount of time\\nthat the disk drive will take to do this, the CPU goes on with so me other task. When the disk\\ndrive has the data ready , it sends an interrupt signal to the C PU. The interrupt handler can\\nthen read the requested data.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nNow, you might have noticed that all this only makes sense if t he CPU actually has several\\ntasks to perform. If it has nothing better to do, it might as we ll spend its time polling for input\\nor waiting for disk drive operations to complete. All modern computers use multitasking to\\nperform several tasks at once. Some computers can be used by s everal people at once. Since the\\nCPU is so fast, it can quickly switch its attention from one us er to another, devoting a fraction\\nof a second to each user in turn. This application of multitas king is called timesharing. But a\\nmodern personal computer with just a single user also uses mu ltitasking. F or example, the user\\nmight be typing a paper while a clock is continuously display ing the time and a ﬁle is being\\ndownloaded over the network.\\nEach of the individual tasks that the CPU is working on is call ed a thread. (Or a process;\\nthere are technical diﬀerences between threads and process es, but they are not important here.)\\nAt any given time, only one thread can actually be executed by a CPU. The CPU will continue\\nrunning the same thread until one of several things happens:\\n• The thread might voluntarily yield control, to give other threads a chance to run.\\n• The thread might have to wait for some asynchronous event to o ccur. F or example, the\\nthread might request some data from the disk drive, or it migh t wait for the user to press\\na key . While it is waiting, the thread is said to be blocked, and other threads have a\\nchance to run. When the event occurs, an interrupt will “wake up” the thread so that it\\ncan continue running.\\n• The thread might use up its allotted slice of time and be suspe nded to allow other threads\\nto run. Not all computers can “forcibly” suspend a thread in t his way; those that can\\nare said to use preemptive multitasking . T o do preemptive multitasking, a computer\\nneeds a special timer device that generates an interrupt at r egular intervals, such as 100\\ntimes per second. When a timer interrupt occurs, the CPU has a chance to switch from\\none thread to another, whether the thread that is currently r unning likes it or not.\\nOrdinary users, and indeed ordinary programmers, have no ne ed to deal with interrupts and\\ninterrupt handlers. They can concentrate on the diﬀerent ta sks or threads that they want the\\ncomputer to perform; the details of how the computer manages to get all those tasks done are\\nnot important to them. In fact, most users, and many programm ers, can ignore threads and'),\n",

THE MENT AL LANDSCAPE\\nmultitasking altogether. However, threads have become inc reasingly important as computers\\nhave become more powerful and as they have begun to make more u se of multitasking. Indeed,\\nthreads are built into the Java programming language as a fun damental programming concept.\\nJust as important in Java and in modern programming in genera l is the basic concept of\\nasynchronous events. While programmers don’t actually dea l with interrupts directly , they\\ndo often ﬁnd themselves writing event handlers , which, like interrupt handlers, are called\\nasynchronously when speciﬁed events occur. Such “event-dr iven programming” has a very\\ndiﬀerent feel from the more traditional straight-through, synchronous programming. W e will\\nbegin with the more traditional type of programming, which i s still used for programming\\nindividual tasks, but we will return to threads and events la ter in the text.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nBy the way , the software that does all the interrupt handling and the communication with\\nthe user and with hardware devices is called the operating system . The operating system is\\nthe basic, essential software without which a computer woul d not be able to function. Other\\nprograms, such as word processors and W orld Wide W eb browser s, are dependent upon the\\noperating system. Common operating systems include Linux, DOS, Windows 2000, Windows\\nXP , and the Macintosh OS.\\n1.3 The Java Virtual Machine\\nMachine language consists of very simple instructions that can be executed directly by\\nthe CPU of a computer. Almost all programs, though, are writt en in high-level programming\\nlanguages such as Java, Pascal, or C++. A program written in a high-leve l language cannot\\nbe run directly on any computer. First, it has to be translate d into machine language. This\\ntranslation can be done by a program called a compiler. A compiler takes a high-level-language\\nprogram and translates it into an executable machine-langu age program. Once the translation\\nis done, the machine-language program can be run any number o f times, but of course it can only\\nbe run on one type of computer (since each type of computer has its own individual machine\\nlanguage). If the program is to run on another type of compute r it has to be re-translated,\\nusing a diﬀerent compiler, into the appropriate machine lan guage.\\nThere is an alternative to compiling a high-level language p rogram. Instead of using a\\ncompiler, which translates the program all at once, you can u se an interpreter, which translates\\nit instruction-by-instruction, as necessary . An interpre ter is a program that acts much like a\\nCPU, with a kind of fetch-and-execute cycle. In order to exec ute a program, the interpreter\\nruns in a loop in which it repeatedly reads one instruction fr om the program, decides what is\\nnecessary to carry out that instruction, and then performs t he appropriate machine-language\\ncommands to do so.\\nOne use of interpreters is to execute high-level language pr ograms. F or example, the pro-\\ngramming language Lisp is usually executed by an interprete r rather than a compiler. However,\\ninterpreters have another purpose: they can let you use a mac hine-language program meant for\\none type of computer on a completely diﬀerent type of compute r. F or example, there is a pro-\\ngram called “Virtual PC” that runs on Macintosh computers. V irtual PC is an interpreter that\\nexecutes machine-language programs written for IBM-PC-cl one computers. If you run Virtual\\nPC on your Macintosh, you can run any PC program, including pr ograms written for Windows.\\n(Unfortunately , a PC program will run much more slowly than i t would on an actual IBM clone.\\nThe problem is that Virtual PC executes several Macintosh ma chine-language instructions for'),\n",

THE JA V A VIR TUAL MACHINE 7\\neach PC machine-language instruction in the program it is in terpreting. Compiled programs\\nare inherently faster than interpreted programs.)\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe designers of Java chose to use a combination of compilati on and interpretation. Pro-\\ngrams written in Java are compiled into machine language, bu t it is a machine language for\\na computer that doesn’t really exist. This so-called “virtu al” computer is known as the Java\\nvirtual machine . The machine language for the Java virtual machine is called Java byte-\\ncode. There is no reason why Java bytecode could not be used as the m achine language of a\\nreal computer, rather than a virtual computer.\\nHowever, one of the main selling points of Java is that it can a ctually be used on any\\ncomputer. All that the computer needs is an interpreter for J ava bytecode. Such an interpreter\\nsimulates the Java virtual machine in the same way that Virtu al PC simulates a PC computer.\\nOf course, a diﬀerent Jave bytecode interpreter is needed fo r each type of computer, but\\nonce a computer has a Java bytecode interpreter, it can run an y Java bytecode program. And\\nthe same Java bytecode program can be run on any computer that has such an interpreter.\\nThis is one of the essential features of Java: the same compil ed program can be run on many\\ndiﬀerent types of computers.\\nJ a v a\\nP r o g r a m C\\no m p i l e r\\nJ a v a\\nB y t e c o d e\\nP r o g r a m\\nJ a v a I n t e r p r e t e r\\nf\\no r M a c O S\\nJ a v a I n t e r p r e t e r\\nf\\no r W i n d o w s\\nJ a v a I n t e r p r e t e r\\nf\\no r L i n u x\\nWhy , you might wonder, use the intermediate Java bytecode at all? Why not just distribute\\nthe original Java program and let each person compile it into the machine language of whatever\\ncomputer they want to run it on? There are many reasons. First of all, a compiler has to\\nunderstand Java, a complex high-level language. The compil er is itself a complex program. A\\nJava bytecode interpreter, on the other hand, is a fairly sma ll, simple program. This makes it\\neasy to write a bytecode interpreter for a new type of compute r; once that is done, that computer\\ncan run any compiled Java program. It would be much harder to w rite a Java compiler for the\\nsame computer.\\nF urthermore, many Java programs are meant to be downloaded o ver a network. This leads\\nto obvious security concerns: you don’t want to download and run a program that will damage\\nyour computer or your ﬁles. The bytecode interpreter acts as a buﬀer between you and the\\nprogram you download. Y ou are really running the interprete r, which runs the downloaded\\nprogram indirectly . The interpreter can protect you from po tentially dangerous actions on the\\npart of that program.\\nI should note that there is no necessary connection between J ava and Java bytecode. A pro-\\ngram written in Java could certainly be compiled into the mac hine language of a real computer.\\nAnd programs written in other languages could be compiled in to Java bytecode. However, it is\\nthe combination of Java and Java bytecode that is platform-i ndependent, secure, and network-\\ncompatible while allowing you to program in a modern high-le vel object-oriented language.'),\n",

THE MENT AL LANDSCAPE\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nI should also note that the really hard part of platform-inde pendence is providing a “Graph-\\nical User Interface”—with windows, buttons, etc.—that wil l work on all the platforms that\\nsupport Java. Y ou’ll see more about this problem in Section 1 .6.\\n1.4 Fundamental Building Blocks of Programs\\nThere are two basic aspects of programming: data and instructions. T o work with\\ndata, you need to understand variables and types; to work with instructions, you need to\\nunderstand control structures and subroutines. Y ou’ll spend a large part of the course\\nbecoming familiar with these concepts.\\nA variable is just a memory location (or several locations treated as a u nit) that has been\\ngiven a name so that it can be easily referred to and used in a pr ogram. The programmer only\\nhas to worry about the name; it is the compiler’s responsibil ity to keep track of the memory\\nlocation. The programmer does need to keep in mind that the na me refers to a kind of “box”\\nin memory that can hold data, even if the programmer doesn’t h ave to know where in memory\\nthat box is located.\\nIn Java and most other languages, a variable has a type that indicates what sort of data\\nit can hold. One type of variable might hold integers—whole n umbers such as 3, -7, and 0—\\nwhile another holds ﬂoating point numbers—numbers with dec imal points such as 3.14, -2.7,\\nor 17.0. (Y es, the computer does make a distinction between t he integer 17 and the ﬂoating-\\npoint number 17.0; they actually look quite diﬀerent inside the computer.) There could also\\nbe types for individual characters (’A’, ’;’, etc.), string s (“Hello”, “A string can include many\\ncharacters”, etc.), and less common types such as dates, col ors, sounds, or any other type of\\ndata that a program might need to store.\\nProgramming languages always have commands for getting dat a into and out of variables\\nand for doing computations with data. F or example, the follo wing “assignment statement,”\\nwhich might appear in a Java program, tells the computer to ta ke the number stored in the\\nvariable named “principal”, multiply that number by 0.07, a nd then store the result in the\\nvariable named “interest”:\\ninterest = principal * 0.07;\\nThere are also “input commands” for getting data from the use r or from ﬁles on the computer’s\\ndisks and “output commands” for sending data in the other dir ection.\\nThese basic commands—for moving data from place to place and for performing\\ncomputations—are the building blocks for all programs. The se building blocks are combined\\ninto complex programs using control structures and subrout ines.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nA program is a sequence of instructions. In the ordinary “ﬂow of control,” the computer\\nexecutes the instructions in the sequence in which they appe ar, one after the other. However,\\nthis is obviously very limited: the computer would soon run o ut of instructions to execute.\\nControl structures are special instructions that can change the ﬂow of control. There are\\ntwo basic types of control structure: loops, which allow a sequence of instructions to be repeated\\nover and over, and branches, which allow the computer to decide between two or more diﬀer ent\\ncourses of action by testing conditions that occur as the pro gram is running.\\nF or example, it might be that if the value of the variable “pri ncipal” is greater than 10000,\\nthen the “interest” should be computed by multiplying the pr incipal by 0.05; if not, then the'),\n",

OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 9\\ninterest should be computed by multiplying the principal by 0.04. A program needs some\\nway of expressing this type of decision. In Java, it could be e xpressed using the following “if\\nstatement”:\\nif (principal > 10000)\\ninterest = principal * 0.05;\\nelse\\ninterest = principal * 0.04;\\n(Don’t worry about the details for now. Just remember that th e computer can test a condition\\nand decide what to do next on the basis of that test.)\\nLoops are used when the same task has to be performed more than once. F or example,\\nif you want to print out a mailing label for each name on a maili ng list, you might say , “Get\\nthe ﬁrst name and address and print the label; get the second n ame and address and print\\nthe label; get the third name and address and print the label— ” But this quickly becomes\\nridiculous—and might not work at all if you don’t know in adva nce how many names there are.\\nWhat you would like to say is something like “While there are m ore names to process, get the\\nnext name and address, and print the label.” A loop can be used in a program to express such\\nrepetition.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nLarge programs are so complex that it would be almost impossi ble to write them if there\\nwere not some way to break them up into manageable “chunks.” S ubroutines provide one way to\\ndo this. A subroutine consists of the instructions for performing some task, grou ped together\\nas a unit and given a name. That name can then be used as a substi tute for the whole set of\\ninstructions. F or example, suppose that one of the tasks tha t your program needs to perform\\nis to draw a house on the screen. Y ou can take the necessary ins tructions, make them into\\na subroutine, and give that subroutine some appropriate nam e—say , “drawHouse()”. Then\\nanyplace in your program where you need to draw a house, you ca n do so with the single\\ncommand:\\ndrawHouse();\\nThis will have the same eﬀect as repeating all the house-draw ing instructions in each place.\\nThe advantage here is not just that you save typing. Organizi ng your program into sub-\\nroutines also helps you organize your thinking and your prog ram design eﬀort. While writing\\nthe house-drawing subroutine, you can concentrate on the pr oblem of drawing a house without\\nworrying for the moment about the rest of the program. And onc e the subroutine is written,\\nyou can forget about the details of drawing houses—that prob lem is solved, since you have a\\nsubroutine to do it for you. A subroutine becomes just like a b uilt-in part of the language which\\nyou can use without thinking about the details of what goes on “inside” the subroutine.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nV ariables, types, loops, branches, and subroutines are the basis of what might be called\\n“traditional programming.” However, as programs become la rger, additional structure is needed\\nto help deal with their complexity . One of the most eﬀective t ools that has been found is object-\\noriented programming, which is discussed in the next sectio n.\\n1.5 Objects and Object-oriented Programming\\nPrograms must be designed .

THE MENT AL LANDSCAPE\\nthe construction of correct, working, well-written progra ms. The software engineer tends to\\nuse accepted and proven methods for analyzing the problem to be solved and for designing a\\nprogram to solve that problem.\\nDuring the 1970s and into the 80s, the primary software engin eering methodology was\\nstructured programming . The structured programming approach to program design was\\nbased on the following advice: T o solve a large problem, brea k the problem into several pieces\\nand work on each piece separately; to solve each piece, treat it as a new problem which can itself\\nbe broken down into smaller problems; eventually , you will w ork your way down to problems\\nthat can be solved directly , without further decomposition . This approach is called top-down\\nprogramming.\\nThere is nothing wrong with top-down programming. It is a val uable and often-used ap-\\nproach to problem-solving. However, it is incomplete. F or o ne thing, it deals almost entirely\\nwith producing the instructions necessary to solve a problem. But as time went on, people\\nrealized that the design of the data structures for a program was as least as important as the\\ndesign of subroutines and control structures. T op-down pro gramming doesn’t give adequate\\nconsideration to the data that the program manipulates.\\nAnother problem with strict top-down programming is that it makes it diﬃcult to reuse\\nwork done for other projects. By starting with a particular p roblem and subdividing it into\\nconvenient pieces, top-down programming tends to produce a design that is unique to that\\nproblem. It is unlikely that you will be able to take a large ch unk of programming from another\\nprogram and ﬁt it into your project, at least not without exte nsive modiﬁcation. Producing\\nhigh-quality programs is diﬃcult and expensive, so program mers and the people who employ\\nthem are always eager to reuse past work.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nSo, in practice, top-down design is often combined with bottom-up design . In bottom-up\\ndesign, the approach is to start “at the bottom,” with proble ms that you already know how to\\nsolve (and for which you might already have a reusable softwa re component at hand). F rom\\nthere, you can work upwards towards a solution to the overall problem.\\nThe reusable components should be as “modular” as possible. A module is a component of a\\nlarger system that interacts with the rest of the system in a s imple, well-deﬁned, straightforward\\nmanner. The idea is that a module can be “plugged into” a syste m. The details of what goes on\\ninside the module are not important to the system as a whole, a s long as the module fulﬁlls its\\nassigned role correctly . This is called information hiding , and it is one of the most important\\nprinciples of software engineering.\\nOne common format for software modules is to contain some dat a, along with some sub-\\nroutines for manipulating that data. F or example, a mailing -list module might contain a list of\\nnames and addresses along with a subroutine for adding a new n ame, a subroutine for printing\\nmailing labels, and so forth. In such modules, the data itsel f is often hidden inside the module;\\na program that uses the module can then manipulate the data on ly indirectly , by calling the\\nsubroutines provided by the module. This protects the data, since it can only be manipulated\\nin known, well-deﬁned ways. And it makes it easier for progra ms to use the module, since they\\ndon’t have to worry about the details of how the data is repres ented. Information about the\\nrepresentation of the data is hidden.\\nModules that could support this kind of information-hiding became common in program-\\nming languages in the early 1980s. Since then, a more advance d form of the same idea has\\nmore or less taken over software engineering. This latest ap proach is called object-oriented\\nprogramming, often abbreviated as OOP .'),\n",

OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 11\\nThe central concept of object-oriented programming is the object, which is a kind of module\\ncontaining data and subroutines. The point-of-view in OOP i s that an object is a kind of self-\\nsuﬃcient entity that has an internal state (the data it contains) and that can respond to\\nmessages (calls to its subroutines). A mailing list object, for examp le, has a state consisting\\nof a list of names and addresses. If you send it a message telli ng it to add a name, it will\\nrespond by modifying its state to reﬂect the change. If you se nd it a message telling it to print\\nitself, it will respond by printing out its list of names and a ddresses.\\nThe OOP approach to software engineering is to start by ident ifying the objects involved in\\na problem and the messages that those objects should respond to. The program that results is\\na collection of objects, each with its own data and its own set of responsibilities. The objects\\ninteract by sending messages to each other. There is not much “top-down” in such a program,\\nand people used to more traditional programs can have a hard t ime getting used to OOP .\\nHowever, people who use OOP would claim that object-oriente d programs tend to be better\\nmodels of the way the world itself works, and that they are the refore easier to write, easier to\\nunderstand, and more likely to be correct.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nY ou should think of objects as “knowing” how to respond to cer tain messages. Diﬀerent\\nobjects might respond to the same message in diﬀerent ways. F or example, a “print” message\\nwould produce very diﬀerent results, depending on the objec t it is sent to. This property of\\nobjects—that diﬀerent objects can respond to the same messa ge in diﬀerent ways—is called\\npolymorphism.\\nIt is common for objects to bear a kind of “family resemblance ” to one another. Objects\\nthat contain the same type of data and that respond to the same messages in the same way\\nbelong to the same class. (In actual programming, the class is primary; that is, a cla ss is\\ncreated and then one or more objects are created using that cl ass as a template.) But objects\\ncan be similar without being in exactly the same class.\\nF or example, consider a drawing program that lets the user dr aw lines, rectangles, ovals,\\npolygons, and curves on the screen. In the program, each visi ble object on the screen could be\\nrepresented by a software object in the program. There would be ﬁve classes of objects in the\\nprogram, one for each type of visible object that can be drawn . All the lines would belong to\\none class, all the rectangles to another class, and so on. The se classes are obviously related;\\nall of them represent “drawable objects.” They would, for ex ample, all presumably be able to\\nrespond to a “draw yourself” message. Another level of group ing, based on the data needed\\nto represent each type of object, is less obvious, but would b e very useful in a program: W e\\ncan group polygons and curves together as “multipoint objec ts,” while lines, rectangles, and\\novals are “two-point objects.” (A line is determined by its e ndpoints, a rectangle by two of its\\ncorners, and an oval by two corners of the rectangle that cont ains it.) W e could diagram these\\nrelationships as follows:'),\n",

The class\\nLine would be a subclass of TwoPointObject and (indirectly) of DrawableObject. A subclass of\\na class is said to inherit the properties of that class. The subclass can add to its inhe ritance and\\nit can even “override” part of that inheritance (by deﬁning a diﬀerent response to some method).\\nNevertheless, lines, rectangles, and so on are drawable objects, and the class DrawableObject\\nexpresses this relationship.\\nInheritance is a powerful means for organizing a program. It is also related to the problem\\nof reusing software components. A class is the ultimate reus able component. Not only can it\\nbe reused directly if it ﬁts exactly into a program you are try ing to write, but if it just almost\\nﬁts, you can still reuse it by deﬁning a subclass and making on ly the small changes necessary\\nto adapt it exactly to your needs.\\nSo, OOP is meant to be both a superior program-development to ol and a partial solution\\nto the software reuse problem. Objects, classes, and object -oriented programming will be\\nimportant themes throughout the rest of this text.\\n1.6 The Modern User Interface\\nWhen computers were first introduced, ordinary people—including most programmers—\\ncouldn’t get near them. They were locked up in rooms with whit e-coated attendants who would\\ntake your programs and data, feed them to the computer, and re turn the computer’s response\\nsome time later. When timesharing—where the computer switc hes its attention rapidly from\\none person to another—was invented in the 1960s, it became po ssible for several people to\\ninteract directly with the computer at the same time. On a tim esharing system, users sit at\\n“terminals” where they type commands to the computer, and th e computer types back its re-\\nsponse. Early personal computers also used typed commands a nd responses, except that there\\nwas only one person involved at a time. This type of interacti on between a user and a computer\\nis called a command-line interface .\\nT oday , of course, most people interact with computers in a co mpletely diﬀerent way . They\\nuse a Graphical User Interface , or GUI. The computer draws interface components on the\\nscreen. The components include things like windows, scroll bars, menus, buttons, and icons.\\nUsually , a mouse is used to manipulate such components. Assuming that you hav e not just\\nbeen teleported in from the 1970s, you are no doubt already fa miliar with the basics of graphical\\nuser interfaces!\\nA lot of GUI interface components have become fairly standar d. That is, they have similar\\nappearance and behavior on many diﬀerent computer platform s including Macintosh, Windows,'),\n",

THE MODERN USER INTERF ACE 13\\nand Linux. Java programs, which are supposed to run on many di ﬀerent platforms without\\nmodiﬁcation to the program, can use all the standard GUI comp onents. They might vary a\\nlittle in appearance from platform to platform, but their fu nctionality should be identical on\\nany computer on which the program runs.\\nShown below is an image of a very simple Java program—actuall y an “ applet ”, since it is\\nmeant to appear on a W eb page—that shows a few standard GUI int erface components. There\\nare four components that the user can interact with: a button , a checkbox, a text ﬁeld, and a\\npop-up menu. These components are labeled. There are a few ot her components in the applet.\\nThe labels themselves are components (even though you can’t interact with them). The right\\nhalf of the applet is a text area component, which can display multiple lines of text, and a\\nscrollbar component appears alongside the text area when th e number of lines of text becomes\\nlarger than will ﬁt in the text area. And in fact, in Java termi nology , the whole applet is itself\\nconsidered to be a “component.”\\nNow, Java actually has two complete sets of GUI components. O ne of these, the A WT or\\nAbstract Windowing Toolkit , was available in the original version of Java. The other, wh ich\\nis known as Swing, is included in Java version 1.2 or later, and is used in prefe rence to the\\nA WT in most modern Java programs. The applet that is shown abo ve uses components that\\nare part of Swing. If your W eb browser uses an old version of Ja va, you might get an error\\nwhen the browser tries to load the applet. Remember that most of the applets in this textbook\\nrequire Java 5.0 (or higher).\\nWhen a user interacts with the GUI components in this applet, an “event” is generated.\\nF or example, clicking a push button generates an event, and p ressing return while typing in a\\ntext ﬁeld generates an event. Each time an event is generated , a message is sent to the applet\\ntelling it that the event has occurred, and the applet respon ds according to its program. In\\nfact, the program consists mainly of “event handlers” that t ell the applet how to respond to\\nvarious types of events. In this example, the applet has been programmed to respond to each\\nevent by displaying a message in the text area.\\nThe use of the term “message” here is deliberate. Messages, a s you saw in the previous sec-\\ntion, are sent to objects. In fact, Java GUI components are im plemented as objects. Java\\nincludes many predeﬁned classes that represent various typ es of GUI components. Some of\\nthese classes are subclasses of others. Here is a diagram sho wing some of Swing’s GUI classes\\nand their relationships:'),\n",

THE INTERNET 15\\nuse TCP/IP to send speciﬁc types of information such as web pa ges, electronic mail, and data\\nﬁles.\\nAll communication over the Internet is in the form of packets. A packet consists of some\\ndata being sent from one computer to another, along with addr essing information that indicates\\nwhere on the Internet that data is supposed to go. Think of a pa cket as an envelope with an\\naddress on the outside and a message on the inside. (The messa ge is the data.) The packet\\nalso includes a “return address,” that is, the address of the sender. A packet can hold only\\na limited amount of data; longer messages must be divided amo ng several packets, which are\\nthen sent individually over the net and reassembled at their destination.\\nEvery computer on the Internet has an IP address , a number that identiﬁes it uniquely\\namong all the computers on the net. The IP address is used for a ddressing packets. A computer\\ncan only send data to another computer on the Internet if it kn ows that computer’s IP address.\\nSince people prefer to use names rather than numbers, most co mputers are also identiﬁed by\\nnames, called domain names . F or example, the main computer of the Mathematics Depart-\\nment at Hobart and William Smith Colleges has the domain name math.hws.edu. (Domain\\nnames are just for convenience; your computer still needs to know IP addresses before it can\\ncommunicate. There are computers on the Internet whose job i t is to translate domain names\\nto IP addresses. When you use a domain name, your computer sen ds a message to a domain\\nname server to ﬁnd out the corresponding IP address. Then, yo ur computer uses the IP address,\\nrather than the domain name, to communicate with the other co mputer.)\\nThe Internet provides a number of services to the computers c onnected to it (and, of course,\\nto the users of those computers). These services use TCP/IP t o send various types of data over\\nthe net. Among the most popular services are instant messagi ng, ﬁle sharing, electronic mail,\\nand the W orld-Wide W eb. Each service has its own protocols, w hich are used to control\\ntransmission of data over the network. Each service also has some sort of user interface, which\\nallows the user to view, send, and receive data through the se rvice.\\nF or example, the email service uses a protocol known as SMTP (Simple Mail T ransfer\\nProtocol) to transfer email messages from one computer to an other. Other protocols, such as\\nPOP and IMAP , are used to fetch messages from an email account so that the recipient can\\nread them. A person who uses email, however, doesn’t need to u nderstand or even know about\\nthese protocols. Instead, they are used behind the scenes by the programs that the person uses\\nto send and receive email messages. These programs provide a n easy-to-use user interface to\\nthe underlying network protocols.\\nThe W orld-Wide W eb is perhaps the most exciting of network se rvices. The W orld-Wide\\nW eb allows you to request pages of information that are stored on computers all over the\\nInternet. A W eb page can contain links to other pages on the same computer from which it\\nwas obtained or to other computers anywhere in the world. A co mputer that stores such pages\\nof information is called a web server . The user interface to the W eb is the type of program\\nknown as a web browser . Common web browsers include Internet Explorer and Firefox . Y ou\\nuse a W eb browser to request a page of information. The browse r will send a request for that\\npage to the computer on which the page is stored, and when a res ponse is received from that\\ncomputer, the web browser displays it to you in a neatly forma tted form. A web browser is just\\na user interface to the W eb. Behind the scenes, the web browse r uses a protocol called HTTP\\n(HyperT ext T ransfer Protocol) to send each page request and to receive the response from the\\nweb server.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nNow just what, you might be thinking, does all this have to do w ith Java? In fact, Java'),\n",

As you have seen in the\\nprevious section, special Java programs called applets are meant to be transmitted over the\\nInternet and displayed on W eb pages. A W eb server transmits a Java applet just as it would\\ntransmit any other type of information. A W eb browser that un derstands Java—that is, that\\nincludes an interpreter for the Java virtual machine—can th en run the applet right on the W eb\\npage. Since applets are programs, they can do almost anythin g, including complex interaction\\nwith the user. With Java, a W eb page becomes more than just a pa ssive display of information.\\nIt becomes anything that programmers can imagine and implem ent.\\nBut applets are only one aspect of Java’s relationship with t he Internet, and not the major\\none. In fact, as both Java and the Internet have matured, appl ets have become less important.\\nAt the same time, however, Java has increasingly been used to write complex, stand-alone\\napplications that do not depend on a web browser. Many of thes e programs are network-\\nrelated. F or example many of the largest and most complex web sites use web server software\\nthat is written in Java. Java includes excellent support for network protocols, and its platform\\nindependence makes it possible to write network programs th at work on many diﬀerent types\\nof computer.\\nIts association with the Internet is not Java’s only advanta ge.

A computer performs complex tasks by stringing together large numbers of such\\noperations. Such tasks must be “scripted” in complete and pe rfect detail by programs. Creating\\ncomplex programs will never be really easy , but the diﬃculty can be handled to some extent by\\ngiving the program a clear overall structure. The design of the overall structure of a program\\nis what I call “programming in the large.”\\nProgramming in the small, which is sometimes called coding, would then refer to ﬁlling in\\nthe details of that design. The details are the explicit, ste p-by-step instructions for performing\\nfairly small-scale tasks. When you do coding, you are workin g fairly “close to the machine,”\\nwith some of the same concepts that you might use in machine la nguage: memory locations,\\narithmetic operations, loops and branches. In a high-level language such as Java, you get to\\nwork with these concepts on a level several steps above machi ne language. However, you still\\nhave to worry about getting all the details exactly right.\\nThis chapter and the next examine the facilities for program ming in the small in the Java\\nprogramming language. Don’t be misled by the term “programm ing in the small” into thinking\\nthat this material is easy or unimportant. This material is a n essential foundation for all types\\nof programming. If you don’t understand it, you can’t write p rograms, no matter how good\\nyou get at designing their large-scale structure.\\n2.1 The Basic Java Application\\nA program is a sequence of instructions that a computer can execute to perform some\\ntask. A simple enough idea, but for the computer to make any us e of the instructions, they\\nmust be written in a form that the computer can use. This means that programs have to be\\nwritten in programming languages . Programming languages diﬀer from ordinary human\\nlanguages in being completely unambiguous and very strict a bout what is and is not allowed\\nin a program. The rules that determine what is allowed are cal led the syntax of the language.\\nSyntax rules specify the basic vocabulary of the language an d how programs can be constructed\\nusing things like loops, branches, and subroutines. A synta ctically correct program is one that\\ncan be successfully compiled or interpreted; programs that have syntax errors will be rejected\\n(hopefully with a useful error message that will help you ﬁx t he problem).\\nSo, to be a successful programmer, you have to develop a detai led knowledge of the syntax\\n19'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\nof the programming language that you are using. However, syn tax is only part of the story . It’s\\nnot enough to write a program that will run—you want a program that will run and produce\\nthe correct result! That is, the meaning of the program has to be right. The meaning of a\\nprogram is referred to as its semantics. A semantically correct program is one that does what\\nyou want it to.\\nF urthermore, a program can be syntactically and semantical ly correct but still be a pretty\\nbad program. Using the language correctly is not the same as u sing it well. F or example, a\\ngood program has “style.” It is written in a way that will make it easy for people to read and\\nto understand. It follows conventions that will be familiar to other programmers. And it has\\nan overall design that will make sense to human readers. The c omputer is completely oblivious\\nto such things, but to a human reader, they are paramount. The se aspects of programming are\\nsometimes referred to as pragmatics.\\nWhen I introduce a new language feature, I will explain the sy ntax, the semantics, and\\nsome of the pragmatics of that feature. Y ou should memorize t he syntax; that’s the easy part.\\nThen you should get a feeling for the semantics by following t he examples given, making sure\\nthat you understand how they work, and maybe writing short pr ograms of your own to test\\nyour understanding. And you should try to appreciate and abs orb the pragmatics—this means\\nlearning how to use the language feature well, with style that will earn you the admiration of\\nother programmers.\\nOf course, even when you’ve become familiar with all the indi vidual features of the language,\\nthat doesn’t make you a programmer. Y ou still have to learn ho w to construct complex programs\\nto solve particular problems. F or that, you’ll need both exp erience and taste. Y ou’ll ﬁnd hints\\nabout software development throughout this textbook.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nW e begin our exploration of Java with the problem that has bec ome traditional for such\\nbeginnings: to write a program that displays the message “He llo W orld!”. This might seem like\\na trivial problem, but getting a computer to do this is really a big ﬁrst step in learning a new\\nprogramming language (especially if it’s your ﬁrst program ming language). It means that you\\nunderstand the basic process of:\\n1. getting the program text into the computer,\\n2. compiling the program, and\\n3. running the compiled program.\\nThe ﬁrst time through, each of these steps will probably take you a few tries to get right. I\\nwon’t go into the details here of how you do each of these steps ; it depends on the particular\\ncomputer and Java programming environment that you are usin g. See Section 2.6 for informa-\\ntion about creating and running Java programs in speciﬁc pro gramming environments. But in\\ngeneral, you will type the program using some sort of text edi tor and save the program in a\\nﬁle. Then, you will use some command to try to compile the ﬁle. Y ou’ll either get a message\\nthat the program contains syntax errors, or you’ll get a comp iled version of the program. In\\nthe case of Java, the program is compiled into Java bytecode, not into machine language. Fi-\\nnally , you can run the compiled program by giving some approp riate command. F or Java, you\\nwill actually use an interpreter to execute the Java bytecod e. Y our programming environment\\nmight automate some of the steps for you, but you can be sure th at the same three steps are\\nbeing done in the background.\\nHere is a Java program to display the message “Hello W orld!”. Don’t expect to understand\\nwhat’s going on here just yet—some of it you won’t really unde rstand until a few chapters from'),\n",

THE BASIC JA V A APPLICA TION 21\\nnow:\\n// A program to display the message\\n// \"Hello World!\" on standard output\\npublic class HelloWorld {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\\n}\\n} // end of class HelloWorld\\nThe command that actually displays the message is:\\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\\nThis command is an example of a subroutine call statement . It uses a “built-in subroutine”\\nnamed System.out.println to do the actual work. Recall that a subroutine consists of th e\\ninstructions for performing some task, chunked together an d given a name. That name can be\\nused to “call” the subroutine whenever that task needs to be p erformed. A built-in subroutine\\nis one that is already deﬁned as part of the language and there fore automatically available for\\nuse in any program.\\nWhen you run this program, the message “Hello W orld!” (witho ut the quotes) will be\\ndisplayed on standard output. Unfortunately , I can’t say ex actly what that means! Java is\\nmeant to run on many diﬀerent platforms, and standard output will mean diﬀerent things on\\ndiﬀerent platforms. However, you can expect the message to s how up in some convenient place.\\n(If you use a command-line interface, like that in Sun Micros ystem’s Java Development Kit,\\nyou type in a command to tell the computer to run the program. T he computer will type the\\noutput from the program, Hello W orld!, on the next line.)\\nY ou must be curious about all the other stuﬀ in the above progr am. Part of it consists of\\ncomments. Comments in a program are entirely ignored by the computer; they are there for\\nhuman readers only . This doesn’t mean that they are unimport ant. Programs are meant to be\\nread by people as well as by computers, and without comments, a program can be very diﬃcult\\nto understand. Java has two types of comments. The ﬁrst type, used in the above program,\\nbegins with // and extends to the end of a line. The computer ig nores the // and everything\\nthat follows it on the same line. Java has another style of com ment that can extend over many\\nlines. That type of comment begins with /* and ends with */.\\nEverything else in the program is required by the rules of Jav a syntax. All programming in\\nJava is done inside “classes.” The ﬁrst line in the above prog ram (not counting the comments)\\nsays that this is a class named HelloWorld. “HelloW orld,” the name of the class, also serves as\\nthe name of the program. Not every class is a program. In order to deﬁne a program, a class\\nmust include a subroutine named main, with a deﬁnition that takes the form:\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nWhen you tell the Java interpreter to run the program, the int erpreter calls the main()\\nsubroutine, and the statements that it contains are execute d. These statements make up the\\nscript that tells the computer exactly what to do when the pro gram is executed. The main()\\nroutine can call subroutines that are deﬁned in the same clas s or even in other classes, but it is\\nthe main() routine that determines how and in what order the other subro utines are used.'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\nThe word “public” in the ﬁrst line of main() means that this routine can be called from out-\\nside the program. This is essential because the main() routine is called by the Java interpreter,\\nwhich is something external to the program itself. The remai nder of the ﬁrst line of the routine\\nis harder to explain at the moment; for now, just think of it as part of the required syntax.\\nThe deﬁnition of the subroutine—that is, the instructions t hat say what it does—consists of\\nthe sequence of “statements” enclosed between braces, { and }. Here, I’ve used ⟨statements⟩ as\\na placeholder for the actual statements that make up the prog ram. Throughout this textbook,\\nI will always use a similar format: anything that you see in ⟨this style of text ⟩ (italic in angle\\nbrackets) is a placeholder that describes something you nee d to type when you write an actual\\nprogram.\\nAs noted above, a subroutine can’t exist by itself. It has to b e part of a “class”. A program\\nis deﬁned by a public class that takes the form:\\npublic class ⟨program-name ⟩ {\\n⟨optional-variable-declarations-and-subroutines ⟩\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\n⟨optional-variable-declarations-and-subroutines ⟩\\n}\\nThe name on the ﬁrst line is the name of the program, as well as t he name of the class. If the\\nname of the class is HelloW orld, then the class must be saved i n a ﬁle called HelloWorld.java.\\nWhen this ﬁle is compiled, another ﬁle named HelloWorld.class will be produced. This class\\nﬁle, HelloWorld.class, contains the Java bytecode that is executed by a Java interp reter.\\nHelloWorld.java is called the source code for the program. T o execute the program, you\\nonly need the compiled class ﬁle, not the source code.\\nThe layout of the program on the page, such as the use of blank l ines and indentation, is\\nnot part of the syntax or semantics of the language. The compu ter doesn’t care about layout—\\nyou could run the entire program together on one line as far as it is concerned. However,\\nlayout is important to human readers, and there are certain s tyle guidelines for layout that are\\nfollowed by most programmers. These style guidelines are pa rt of the pragmatics of the Java\\nprogramming language.\\nAlso note that according to the above syntax speciﬁcation, a program can contain other\\nsubroutines besides main(), as well as things called “variable declarations.” Y ou’ll l earn more\\nabout these later, but not until Chapter 4.\\n2.2 Variables and the Primitive Types\\nNames are fundamental to programming. In programs, names are used to refer to many\\ndiﬀerent sorts of things. In order to use those things, a prog rammer must understand the rules\\nfor giving names to things and the rules for using the names to work with those things. That\\nis, the programmer must understand the syntax and the semant ics of names.\\nAccording to the syntax rules of Java, a name is a sequence of o ne or more characters. It must\\nbegin with a letter or underscore and must consist entirely o f letters, digits, and underscores.\\n(“Underscore” refers to the character ’\\n’.) F or example, here are some legal names:\\nN n rate x15 quite a long name HelloWorld'),\n",

V ARIABLES AND TYPES 23\\nNo spaces are allowed in identiﬁers; HelloWorld is a legal identiﬁer, but “Hello W orld” is\\nnot. Upper case and lower case letters are considered to be di ﬀerent, so that HelloWorld,\\nhelloworld, HELLOWORLD, and hElloWorLD are all distinct names. Certain names are reserved\\nfor special uses in Java, and cannot be used by the programmer for other purposes. These\\nreserved words include: class, public, static, if, else, while, and several dozen other\\nwords.\\nJava is actually pretty liberal about what counts as a letter or a digit. Java uses the\\nUnicode character set, which includes thousands of characters from many diﬀerent languages\\nand diﬀerent alphabets, and many of these characters count a s letters or digits. However, I will\\nbe sticking to what can be typed on a regular English keyboard .\\nThe pragmatics of naming includes style guidelines about ho w to choose names for things.\\nF or example, it is customary for names of classes to begin wit h upper case letters, while names\\nof variables and of subroutines begin with lower case letter s; you can avoid a lot of confusion\\nby following the same convention in your own programs. Most J ava programmers do not use\\nunderscores in names, although some do use them at the beginn ing of the names of certain kinds\\nof variables. When a name is made up of several words, such as HelloWorld or interestRate,\\nit is customary to capitalize each word, except possibly the ﬁrst; this is sometimes referred\\nto as camel case , since the upper case letters in the middle of a name are suppo sed to look\\nsomething like the humps on a camel’s back.\\nFinally , I’ll note that things are often referred to by compound names which consist\\nof several ordinary names separated by periods. (Compound n ames are also called qualiﬁed\\nnames.) Y ou’ve already seen an example: System.out.println. The idea here is that things\\nin Java can contain other things. A compound name is a kind of p ath to an item through one\\nor more levels of containment. The name System.out.println indicates that something called\\n“System” contains something called “out” which in turn cont ains something called “println”.\\nNon-compound names are called simple identiﬁers . I’ll use the term identiﬁer to refer to\\nany name—simple or compound—that can be used to refer to some thing in Java. (Note that\\nthe reserved words are not identiﬁers, since they can’t be used as names for things.)\\n2.2.1 Variables\\nPrograms manipulate data that are stored in memory . In machi ne language, data can only\\nbe referred to by giving the numerical address of the locatio n in memory where it is stored.\\nIn a high-level language such as Java, names are used instead of numbers to refer to data. It\\nis the job of the computer to keep track of where in memory the d ata is actually stored; the\\nprogrammer only has to remember the name. A name used in this w ay—to refer to data stored\\nin memory—is called a variable.\\nV ariables are actually rather subtle. Properly speaking, a variable is not a name for the\\ndata itself but for a location in memory that can hold data. Y o u should think of a variable as\\na container or box where you can store data that you will need t o use later. The variable refers\\ndirectly to the box and only indirectly to the data in the box. Since the data in the box can\\nchange, a variable can refer to diﬀerent data values at diﬀer ent times during the execution of\\nthe program, but it always refers to the same box. Confusion c an arise, especially for beginning\\nprogrammers, because when a variable is used in a program in c ertain ways, it refers to the\\ncontainer, but when it is used in other ways, it refers to the d ata in the container. Y ou’ll see\\nexamples of both cases below.\\n(In this way , a variable is something like the title, “The Pre sident of the United States.”\\nThis title can refer to diﬀerent people at diﬀerent times, bu t it always refers to the same oﬃce.'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\nIf I say “the President went ﬁshing,” I mean that George W. Bus h went ﬁshing. But if I say\\n“Hillary Clinton wants to be President” I mean that she wants to ﬁll the oﬃce, not that she\\nwants to be George Bush.)\\nIn Java, the only way to get data into a variable—that is, into the box that the v ariable\\nnames—is with an assignment statement . An assignment statement takes the form:\\n⟨variable ⟩ = ⟨expression ⟩;\\nwhere ⟨expression⟩ represents anything that refers to or computes a data value. When the\\ncomputer comes to an assignment statement in the course of ex ecuting a program, it evaluates\\nthe expression and puts the resulting data value into the var iable. F or example, consider the\\nsimple assignment statement\\nrate = 0.07;\\nThe ⟨variable⟩ in this assignment statement is rate, and the ⟨expression⟩ is the number 0.07.\\nThe computer executes this assignment statement by putting the number 0.07 in the variable\\nrate, replacing whatever was there before. Now, consider the fol lowing more complicated\\nassignment statement, which might come later in the same pro gram:\\ninterest = rate * principal;\\nHere, the value of the expression “ rate * principal” is being assigned to the variable\\ninterest. In the expression, the * is a “multiplication operator” that tells the computer\\nto multiply rate times principal. The names rate and principal are themselves variables,\\nand it is really the values stored in those variables that are to be multiplied. W e see th at when\\na variable is used in an expression, it is the value stored in t he variable that matters; in this\\ncase, the variable seems to refer to the data in the box, rathe r than to the box itself. When\\nthe computer executes this assignment statement, it takes t he value of rate, multiplies it by\\nthe value of principal, and stores the answer in the box referred to by interest. When a\\nvariable is used on the left-hand side of an assignment state ment, it refers to the box that is\\nnamed by the variable.\\n(Note, by the way , that an assignment statement is a command t hat is executed by the\\ncomputer at a certain time. It is not a statement of fact. F or e xample, suppose a program\\nincludes the statement “ rate = 0.07;”. If the statement “ interest = rate * principal;”\\nis executed later in the program, can we say that the principal is multiplied by 0.07? No!\\nThe value of rate might have been changed in the meantime by another statement . The\\nmeaning of an assignment statement is completely diﬀerent f rom the meaning of an equation\\nin mathematics, even though both use the symbol “=”.)\\n2.2.2 Types and Literals\\nA variable in Java is designed to hold only one particular typ e of data; it can legally hold that\\ntype of data and no other. The compiler will consider it to be a syntax error if you try to\\nviolate this rule. W e say that Java is a strongly typed language because it enforces this rule.\\nThere are eight so-called primitive types built into Java. The primitive types are named\\nbyte, short, int, long, ﬂoat , double, char, and boolean. The ﬁrst four types hold integers\\n(whole numbers such as 17, -38477, and 0). The four integer ty pes are distinguished by the\\nranges of integers they can hold. The ﬂoat and double types hold real numbers (such as 3.6 and\\n-145.99). Again, the two real types are distinguished by the ir range and accuracy . A variable\\nof type char holds a single character from the Unicode character set. And a variable of type\\nboolean holds one of the two logical values true or false.'),\n",

V ARIABLES AND TYPES 25\\nAny data value stored in the computer’s memory must be repres ented as a binary number,\\nthat is as a string of zeros and ones. A single zero or one is cal led a bit. A string of eight\\nbits is called a byte. Memory is usually measured in terms of bytes. Not surprisin gly , the byte\\ndata type refers to a single byte of memory . A variable of type byte holds a string of eight\\nbits, which can represent any of the integers between -128 an d 127, inclusive. (There are 256\\nintegers in that range; eight bits can represent 256—two rai sed to the power eight—diﬀerent\\nvalues.) As for the other integer types,\\n• short corresponds to two bytes (16 bits). V ariables of type short have values in the range\\n-32768 to 32767.\\n• int corresponds to four bytes (32 bits). V ariables of type int have values in the range\\n-2147483648 to 2147483647.\\n• long corresponds to eight bytes (64 bits). V ariables of type long have values in the range\\n-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.\\nY ou don’t have to remember these numbers, but they do give you some idea of the size of\\nintegers that you can work with. Usually , you should just sti ck to the int data type, which is\\ngood enough for most purposes.\\nThe ﬂoat data type is represented in four bytes of memory , using a stan dard method for\\nencoding real numbers. The maximum value for a ﬂoat is about 10 raised to the power 38.\\nA ﬂoat can have about 7 signiﬁcant digits. (So that 32.3989231134 a nd 32.3989234399 would\\nboth have to be rounded oﬀ to about 32.398923 in order to be sto red in a variable of type\\nﬂoat .) A double takes up 8 bytes, can range up to about 10 to the power 308, and h as about\\n15 signiﬁcant digits. Ordinarily , you should stick to the double type for real values.\\nA variable of type char occupies two bytes in memory . The value of a char variable is a\\nsingle character such as A, *, x, or a space character. The val ue can also be a special character\\nsuch a tab or a carriage return or one of the many Unicode chara cters that come from diﬀerent\\nlanguages. When a character is typed into a program, it must b e surrounded by single quotes;\\nfor example: ’A’, ’*’, or ’x’. Without the quotes, A would be a n identiﬁer and * would be a\\nmultiplication operator. The quotes are not part of the valu e and are not stored in the variable;\\nthey are just a convention for naming a particular character constant in a program.\\nA name for a constant value is called a literal. A literal is what you have to type in a\\nprogram to represent a value. ’A’ and ’*’ are literals of type char, representing the character\\nvalues A and *. Certain special characters have special lite rals that use a backslash, \\\\, as an\\n“escape character”. In particular, a tab is represented as ’\\\\t’, a carriage return as ’\\\\r’, a\\nlinefeed as ’\\\\n’, the single quote character as ’\\\\’’, and the backslash itself as ’\\\\\\\\’. Note that\\neven though you type two characters between the quotes in ’\\\\t’, the value represented by this\\nliteral is a single tab character.\\nNumeric literals are a little more complicated than you migh t expect. Of course, there\\nare the obvious literals such as 317 and 17.42. But there are o ther possibilities for expressing\\nnumbers in a Java program. First of all, real numbers can be re presented in an exponential\\nform such as 1.3e12 or 12.3737e-108. The “e12” and “e-108” re present powers of 10, so that\\n1.3e12 means 1.3 times 10 12 and 12.3737e-108 means 12.3737 times 10 −108. This format can\\nbe used to express very large and very small numbers. Any nume rical literal that contains a\\ndecimal point or exponential is a literal of type double. T o make a literal of type ﬂoat , you\\nhave to append an “F” or “f” to the end of the number. F or exampl e, “1.2F” stands for 1.2\\nconsidered as a value of type ﬂoat . (Occasionally , you need to know this because the rules of\\nJava say that you can’t assign a value of type double to a variable of type ﬂoat , so you might be'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\nconfronted with a ridiculous-seeming error message if you t ry to do something like “ x = 1.2;”\\nwhen x is a variable of type ﬂoat . Y ou have to say “ x = 1.2F;\". This is one reason why I\\nadvise sticking to type double for real numbers.)\\nEven for integer literals, there are some complications. Or dinary integers such as 177777\\nand -32 are literals of type byte, short, or int, depending on their size. Y ou can make a literal\\nof type long by adding “L” as a suﬃx. F or example: 17L or 728476874368L. As another\\ncomplication, Java allows octal (base-8) and hexadecimal ( base-16) literals. I don’t want to\\ncover base-8 and base-16 in detail, but in case you run into th em in other people’s programs,\\nit’s worth knowing a few things: Octal numbers use only the di gits 0 through 7. In Java, a\\nnumeric literal that begins with a 0 is interpreted as an octa l number; for example, the literal\\n045 represents the number 37, not the number 45. Hexadecimal numbers use 16 digits, the\\nusual digits 0 through 9 and the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. Upp er case and lower case letters\\ncan be used interchangeably in this context. The letters rep resent the numbers 10 through 15.\\nIn Java, a hexadecimal literal begins with 0x or 0X, as in 0x45 or 0xFF7A.\\nHexadecimal numbers are also used in character literals to r epresent arbitrary Unicode\\ncharacters. A Unicode literal consists of \\\\u followed by four hexadecimal digits. F or example,\\nthe character literal ’\\\\u00E9’ represents the Unicode character that is an “e” with an acute\\naccent.\\nF or the type boolean, there are precisely two literals: true and false. These literals are\\ntyped just as I’ve written them here, without quotes, but the y represent values, not variables.\\nBoolean values occur most often as the values of conditional expressions. F or example,\\nrate > 0.05\\nis a boolean-valued expression that evaluates to true if the value of the variable rate is greater\\nthan 0.05, and to false if the value of rate is not greater than 0.05. As you’ll see in Chapter 3,\\nboolean-valued expressions are used extensively in contro l structures. Of course, boolean values\\ncan also be assigned to variables of type boolean.\\nJava has other types in addition to the primitive types, but a ll the other types represent\\nobjects rather than “primitive” data values. F or the most pa rt, we are not concerned with\\nobjects for the time being. However, there is one predeﬁned o bject type that is very important:\\nthe type String. A String is a sequence of characters. Y ou’ve already seen a string lit eral:\\n\"Hello World!\". The double quotes are part of the literal; they have to be typ ed in the\\nprogram. However, they are not part of the actual string valu e, which consists of just the\\ncharacters between the quotes. Within a string, special cha racters can be represented using\\nthe backslash notation. Within this context, the double quo te is itself a special character. F or\\nexample, to represent the string value\\nI said, \"Are you listening!\"\\nwith a linefeed at the end, you would have to type the string literal:\\n\"I said, \\\\\"Are you listening!\\\\\"\\\\n\"\\nY ou can also use \\\\t, \\\\r, \\\\\\\\, and unicode sequences such as \\\\u00E9 to represent other special\\ncharacters in string literals. Because strings are objects , their behavior in programs is peculiar\\nin some respects (to someone who is not used to objects). I’ll have more to say about them in\\nthe next section.'),\n",

V ARIABLES AND TYPES 27\\n2.2.3 Variables in Programs\\nA variable can be used in a program only if it has ﬁrst been declared. A variable declaration\\nstatement is used to declare one or more variables and to give them names . When the computer\\nexecutes a variable declaration, it sets aside memory for th e variable and associates the variable’s\\nname with that memory . A simple variable declaration takes t he form:\\n⟨type-name ⟩ ⟨ variable-name-or-names ⟩;\\nThe ⟨variable-name-or-names⟩ can be a single variable name or a list of variable names\\nseparated by commas. (W e’ll see later that variable declara tion statements can actually be\\nsomewhat more complicated than this.) Good programming sty le is to declare only one variable\\nin a declaration statement, unless the variables are closel y related in some way . F or example:\\nint numberOfStudents;\\nString name;\\ndouble x, y;\\nboolean isFinished;\\nchar firstInitial, middleInitial, lastInitial;\\nIt is also good style to include a comment with each variable d eclaration to explain its\\npurpose in the program, or to give other information that mig ht be useful to a human reader.\\nF or example:\\ndouble principal; // Amount of money invested.\\ndouble interestRate; // Rate as a decimal, not percentage.\\nIn this chapter, we will only use variables declared inside t he main() subroutine of a pro-\\ngram. V ariables declared inside a subroutine are called local variables for that subroutine.\\nThey exist only inside the subroutine, while it is running, a nd are completely inaccessible from\\noutside. V ariable declarations can occur anywhere inside t he subroutine, as long as each variable\\nis declared before it is used in any expression. Some people l ike to declare all the variables at\\nthe beginning of the subroutine. Others like to wait to decla re a variable until it is needed. My\\npreference: Declare important variables at the beginning o f the subroutine, and use a comment\\nto explain the purpose of each variable. Declare “utility va riables” which are not important to\\nthe overall logic of the subroutine at the point in the subrou tine where they are ﬁrst used. Here\\nis a simple program using some variables and assignment stat ements:\\n/**\\n* This class implements a simple program that\\n* will compute the amount of interest that is\\n* earned on $17,000 invested at an interest\\n* rate of 0.07 for one year. The interest and\\n* the value of the investment after one year are\\n* printed to standard output.\\n*/\\npublic class Interest {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\n/* Declare the variables. */\\ndouble principal; // The value of the investment.\\ndouble rate; // The annual interest rate.\\ndouble interest; // Interest earned in one year.'),\n",

Two diﬀerent subroutines are used: System.out.print and System.out.println.\\nThe diﬀerence between these is that System.out.println adds a linefeed after the end of the\\ninformation that it displays, while System.out.print does not. Thus, the value of interest,\\nwhich is displayed by the subroutine call “ System.out.println(interest);”, follows on the\\nsame line after the string displayed by the previous System.out.print statement. Note that\\nthe value to be displayed by System.out.print or System.out.println is provided in paren-\\ntheses after the subroutine name. This value is called a parameter to the subroutine. A\\nparameter provides a subroutine with information it needs t o perform its task. In a subroutine\\ncall statement, any parameters are listed in parentheses af ter the subroutine name. Not all\\nsubroutines have parameters. If there are no parameters in a subroutine call statement, the\\nsubroutine name must be followed by an empty pair of parenthe ses.\\nAll the sample programs for this textbook are available in se parate source code ﬁles in the\\non-line version of this text at http://math.hws.edu/javan otes/source. They are also included\\nin the downloadable archives of the web site. The source code for the Interest program, for\\nexample, can be found in the ﬁle Interest.java.\\n2.3 Strings, Objects, Enums, and Subroutines\\nThe previous section introduced the eight primitive data types and the type String. There\\nis a fundamental diﬀerence between the primitive types and t he String type: V alues of type\\nString are objects. While we will not study objects in detail until C hapter 5, it will be useful\\nfor you to know a little about them and about a closely related topic: classes. This is not\\njust because strings are useful but because objects and clas ses are essential to understanding\\nanother important programming concept, subroutines.\\nAnother reason for considering classes and objects at this p oint is so that we can introduce\\nenums. An enum is a data type that can be created by a Java programmer to represent a\\nsmall collection of possible values. T echnically , an enum i s a class and its possible values are\\nobjects. Enums will be our ﬁrst example of adding a new type to the Java language. W e will\\nlook at them later in this section.'),\n",

OBJECTS AND SUBROUTINES 29\\n2.3.1 Built-in Subroutines and F unctions\\nRecall that a subroutine is a set of program instructions tha t have been chunked together and\\ngiven a name. In Chapter 4, you’ll learn how to write your own s ubroutines, but you can\\nget a lot done in a program just by calling subroutines that ha ve already been written for\\nyou. In Java, every subroutine is contained in a class or in an object. Some classes that are\\nstandard parts of the Java language contain predeﬁned subro utines that you can use. A value\\nof type String, which is an object, contains subroutines that can be used to manipulate that\\nstring. These subroutines are “built into” the Java languag e. Y ou can call all these subroutines\\nwithout understanding how they were written or how they work . Indeed, that’s the whole point\\nof subroutines: A subroutine is a “black box” which can be use d without knowing what goes\\non inside.\\nClasses in Java have two very diﬀerent functions. First of al l, a class can group together\\nvariables and subroutines that are contained in that class. These variables and subroutines\\nare called static members of the class. Y ou’ve seen one example: In a class that deﬁnes a\\nprogram, the main() routine is a static member of the class. The parts of a class de ﬁnition that\\ndeﬁne static members are marked with the reserved word “ static”, just like the main() routine\\nof a program. However, classes have a second function. They a re used to describe objects. In\\nthis role, the class of an object speciﬁes what subroutines a nd variables are contained in that\\nobject. The class is a type—in the technical sense of a speciﬁcation of a certain type of data\\nvalue—and the object is a value of that type. F or example, String is actually the name of a\\nclass that is included as a standard part of the Java language . String is also a type, and literal\\nstrings such as \"Hello World\" represent values of type String.\\nSo, every subroutine is contained either in a class or in an ob ject. Classes contain subrou-\\ntines called static member subroutines. Classes also describe objects and the subroutines that\\nare contained in those objects.\\nThis dual use can be confusing, and in practice most classes a re designed to perform pri-\\nmarily or exclusively in only one of the two possible roles. F or example, although the String\\nclass does contain a few rarely-used static member subrouti nes, it exists mainly to specify a\\nlarge number of subroutines that are contained in objects of type String. Another standard\\nclass, named Math, exists entirely to group together a number of static member subroutines\\nthat compute various common mathematical functions.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nT o begin to get a handle on all of this complexity , let’s look a t the subroutine\\nSystem.out.print as an example. As you have seen earlier in this chapter, this s ubroutine\\nis used to display information to the user. F or example, System.out.print(\"Hello World\")\\ndisplays the message, Hello W orld.\\nSystem is one of Java’s standard classes. One of the static member va riables in this class is\\nnamed out. Since this variable is contained in the class System, its full name—which you have\\nto use to refer to it in your programs—is System.out. The variable System.out refers to an\\nobject, and that object in turn contains a subroutine named print. The compound identiﬁer\\nSystem.out.print refers to the subroutine print in the object out in the class System.\\n(As an aside, I will note that the object referred to by System.out is an object of the class\\nPrintStream. PrintStream is another class that is a standard part of Java. Any object of\\ntype PrintStream is a destination to which information can be printed; any object of type\\nPrintStream has a print subroutine that can be used to send information to that desti nation.\\nThe object System.out is just one possible destination, and System.out.print is the subrou-'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\ntine that sends information to that particular destination . Other objects of type PrintStream\\nmight send information to other destinations such as ﬁles or across a network to other com-\\nputers. This is object-oriented programming: Many diﬀeren t things which have something in\\ncommon—they can all be used as destinations for information —can all be used in the same\\nway—through a print subroutine. The PrintStream class expresses the commonalities among\\nall these objects.)\\nSince class names and variable names are used in similar ways , it might be hard to tell\\nwhich is which. Remember that all the built-in, predeﬁned na mes in Java follow the rule that\\nclass names begin with an upper case letter while variable na mes begin with a lower case letter.\\nWhile this is not a formal syntax rule, I recommend that you fo llow it in your own programming.\\nSubroutine names should also begin with lower case letters. There is no possibility of confusing\\na variable with a subroutine, since a subroutine name in a pro gram is always followed by a left\\nparenthesis.\\n(As one ﬁnal general note, you should be aware that subroutin es in Java are often referred\\nto as methods. Generally , the term “method” means a subroutine that is con tained in a class\\nor in an object. Since this is true of every subroutine in Java , every subroutine in Java is\\na method. The same is not true for other programming language s. Nevertheless, the term\\n“method” is mostly used in the context of object-oriented pr ogramming, and until we start\\ndoing real object-oriented programming in Chapter 5, I will prefer to use the more general\\nterm, “subroutine.”)\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nClasses can contain static member subroutines, as well as st atic member variables. F or\\nexample, the System class contains a subroutine named exit. In a program, of course, this\\nsubroutine must be referred to as System.exit. Calling this subroutine will terminate the\\nprogram. Y ou could use it if you had some reason to terminate t he program before the end\\nof the main routine. F or historical reasons, this subroutine takes an i nteger as a parameter,\\nso the subroutine call statement might look like “ System.exit(0);” or “ System.exit(1);”.\\n(The parameter tells the computer why the program was termin ated. A parameter value of 0\\nindicates that the program ended normally . Any other value i ndicates that the program was\\nterminated because an error was detected. But in practice, t he value of the parameter is usually\\nignored.)\\nEvery subroutine performs some speciﬁc task. F or some subro utines, that task is to compute\\nor retrieve some data value. Subroutines of this type are cal led functions. W e say that a\\nfunction returns a value. The returned value must then be used somehow in the pr ogram.\\nY ou are familiar with the mathematical function that comput es the square root of a num-\\nber. Java has a corresponding function called Math.sqrt. This function is a static member\\nsubroutine of the class named Math. If x is any numerical value, then Math.sqrt(x) computes\\nand returns the square root of that value. Since Math.sqrt(x) represents a value, it doesn’t\\nmake sense to put it on a line by itself in a subroutine call sta tement such as\\nMath.sqrt(x); // This doesn’t make sense!\\nWhat, after all, would the computer do with the value compute d by the function in this case?\\nY ou have to tell the computer to do something with the value. Y ou might tell the computer to\\ndisplay it:\\nSystem.out.print( Math.sqrt(x) ); // Display the square ro ot of x.\\nor you might use an assignment statement to tell the computer to store that value in a variable:'),\n",

OBJECTS AND SUBROUTINES 31\\nlengthOfSide = Math.sqrt(x);\\nThe function call Math.sqrt(x) represents a value of type double, and it can be used anyplace\\nwhere a numeric literal of type double could be used.\\nThe Math class contains many static member functions. Here is a list o f some of the more\\nimportant of them:\\n• Math.abs(x), which computes the absolute value of x.\\n• The usual trigonometric functions, Math.sin(x), Math.cos(x), and Math.tan(x). (F or\\nall the trigonometric functions, angles are measured in rad ians, not degrees.)\\n• The inverse trigonometric functions arcsin, arccos, and ar ctan, which are written as:\\nMath.asin(x), Math.acos(x), and Math.atan(x). The return value is expressed in radi-\\nans, not degrees.\\n• The exponential function Math.exp(x) for computing the number e raised to the power\\nx, and the natural logarithm function Math.log(x) for computing the logarithm of x in\\nthe base e.\\n• Math.pow(x,y) for computing x raised to the power y.\\n• Math.floor(x), which rounds x down to the nearest integer value that is less than or\\nequal to x. Even though the return value is mathematically an integer, it is returned\\nas a value of type double, rather than of type int as you might expect. F or example,\\nMath.floor(3.76) is 3.0. The function Math.round(x) returns the integer that is closest\\nto x.\\n• Math.random(), which returns a randomly chosen double in the range 0.0 <=\\nMath.random() < 1.0. (The computer actually calculates so-called “pseudorand om”\\nnumbers, which are not truly random but are random enough for most purposes.)\\nF or these functions, the type of the parameter—the x or y inside the parentheses—can be\\nany value of any numeric type. F or most of the functions, the v alue returned by the function\\nis of type double no matter what the type of the parameter. However, for Math.abs(x), the\\nvalue returned will be the same type as x; if x is of type int, then so is Math.abs(x). So, for\\nexample, while Math.sqrt(9) is the double value 3.0, Math.abs(9) is the int value 9.\\nNote that Math.random() does not have any parameter. Y ou still need the parentheses, even\\nthough there’s nothing between them. The parentheses let th e computer know that this is a sub-\\nroutine rather than a variable. Another example of a subrout ine that has no parameters is the\\nfunction System.currentTimeMillis(), from the System class. When this function is executed,\\nit retrieves the current time, expressed as the number of mil liseconds that have passed since a\\nstandardized base time (the start of the year 1970 in Greenwi ch Mean Time, if you care). One\\nmillisecond is one-thousandth of a second. The return value of System.currentTimeMillis()\\nis of type long. This function can be used to measure the time that it takes th e computer to\\nperform a task. Just record the time at which the task is begun and the time at which it is\\nﬁnished and take the diﬀerence.\\nHere is a sample program that performs a few mathematical tas ks and reports the time\\nthat it takes for the program to run. On some computers, the ti me reported might be zero,\\nbecause it is too small to measure in milliseconds. Even if it ’s not zero, you can be sure that\\nmost of the time reported by the computer was spent doing outp ut or working on tasks other\\nthan the program, since the calculations performed in this p rogram occupy only a tiny fraction\\nof a second of a computer’s time.'),\n",

That object contains data, namely the sequence of characters\\nthat make up the string. It also contains subroutines. All of these subroutines are in fact\\nfunctions. F or example, every string object contains a func tion named length that computes\\nthe number of characters in that string. Suppose that advice is a variable that refers to a\\nString. F or example, advice might have been declared and assigned a value as follows:\\nString advice;\\nadvice = \"Seize the day!\";'),\n",

OBJECTS AND SUBROUTINES 33\\nThen advice.length() is a function call that returns the number of characters in th e string\\n“Seize the day!”. In this case, the return value would be 14. I n general, for any string variable\\nstr, the value of str.length() is an int equal to the number of characters in the string that is\\nthe value of str. Note that this function has no parameter; the particular st ring whose length\\nis being computed is the value of str. The length subroutine is deﬁned by the class String,\\nand it can be used with any value of type String. It can even be used with String literals, which\\nare, after all, just constant values of type String. F or example, you could have a program count\\nthe characters in “Hello W orld” for you by saying\\nSystem.out.print(\"The number of characters in \");\\nSystem.out.println(\"the string \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" is \");\\nSystem.out.println( \"Hello World\".length() );\\nThe String class deﬁnes a lot of functions. Here are some that you might ﬁ nd useful. Assume\\nthat s1 and s2 refer to values of type String :\\n• s1.equals(s2) is a function that returns a boolean value. It returns true if s1 consists\\nof exactly the same sequence of characters as s2, and returns false otherwise.\\n• s1.equalsIgnoreCase(s2) is another boolean-valued function that checks whether s1\\nis the same string as s2, but this function considers upper and lower case letters\\nto be equivalent. Thus, if s1 is “cat”, then s1.equals(\"Cat\") is false, while\\ns1.equalsIgnoreCase(\"Cat\") is true.\\n• s1.length(), as mentioned above, is an integer-valued function that giv es the number of\\ncharacters in s1.\\n• s1.charAt(N), where N is an integer, returns a value of type char. It returns the N-\\nth character in the string. Positions are numbered starting with 0, so s1.charAt(0) is\\nactually the ﬁrst character, s1.charAt(1) is the second, and so on. The ﬁnal position is\\ns1.length() - 1. F or example, the value of \"cat\".charAt(1) is ’a’. An error occurs if\\nthe value of the parameter is less than zero or greater than s1.length() - 1.\\n• s1.substring(N,M), where N and M are integers, returns a value of type String. The\\nreturned value consists of the characters in s1 in positions N, N+1,. . . , M-1. Note that the\\ncharacter in position M is not included. The returned value is called a substring of s1.\\n• s1.indexOf(s2) returns an integer. If s2 occurs as a substring of s1, then the returned\\nvalue is the starting position of that substring. Otherwise , the returned value is -1. Y ou\\ncan also use s1.indexOf(ch) to search for a particular character, ch, in s1. T o ﬁnd the\\nﬁrst occurrence of x at or after position N, you can use s1.indexOf(x,N).\\n• s1.compareTo(s2) is an integer-valued function that compares the two strings . If the\\nstrings are equal, the value returned is zero. If s1 is less than s2, the value returned is\\na number less than zero, and if s1 is greater than s2, the value returned is some number\\ngreater than zero. (If both of the strings consist entirely o f lower case letters, then “less\\nthan” and “greater than” refer to alphabetical order. Other wise, the ordering is more\\ncomplicated.)\\n• s1.toUpperCase() is a String -valued function that returns a new string that is equal to s1,\\nexcept that any lower case letters in s1 have been converted to upper case. F or example,\\n\"Cat\".toUpperCase() is the string \"CAT\". There is also a function s1.toLowerCase().\\n• s1.trim() is a String -valued function that returns a new string that is equal to s1 except\\nthat any non-printing characters such as spaces and tabs hav e been trimmed from the'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\nbeginning and from the end of the string. Thus, if s1 has the value \"fred \" , then\\ns1.trim() is the string \"fred\".\\nF or the functions s1.toUpperCase(), s1.toLowerCase(), and s1.trim(), note that the\\nvalue of s1 is not modiﬁed. Instead a new string is created and returned as the v alue of\\nthe function. The returned value could be used, for example, in an assignment statement\\nsuch as “ smallLetters = s1.toLowerCase();”. T o change the value of s1, you could use an\\nassignment “ s1 = s1.toLowerCase();”.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nHere is another extremely useful fact about strings: Y ou can use the plus operator, +, to\\nconcatenate two strings. The concatenation of two strings is a new string consisting of all the\\ncharacters of the ﬁrst string followed by all the characters of the second string. F or example,\\n\"Hello\" + \"World\" evaluates to \"HelloWorld\". (Gotta watch those spaces, of course—if you\\nwant a space in the concatenated string, it has to be somewher e in the input data, as in\\n\"Hello \" + \"World\".)\\nLet’s suppose that name is a variable of type String and that it already refers to the name\\nof the person using the program. Then, the program could gree t the user by executing the\\nstatement:\\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello, \" + name + \". Pleased to meet you !\");\\nEven more surprising is that you can actually concatenate va lues of any type onto a String\\nusing the + operator. The value is converted to a string, just as it would be if you printed it to\\nthe standard output, and then it is concatenated onto the str ing. F or example, the expression\\n\"Number\" + 42 evaluates to the string \"Number42\". And the statements\\nSystem.out.print(\"After \");\\nSystem.out.print(years);\\nSystem.out.print(\" years, the value is \");\\nSystem.out.print(principal);\\ncan be replaced by the single statement:\\nSystem.out.print(\"After \" + years +\\n\" years, the value is \" + principal);\\nObviously , this is very convenient. It would have shortened some of the examples presented\\nearlier in this chapter.\\n2.3.3 Introduction to Enums\\nJava comes with eight built-in primitive types and a large se t of types that are deﬁned by\\nclasses, such as String. But even this large collection of types is not suﬃcient to co ver all the\\npossible situations that a programmer might have to deal wit h. So, an essential part of Java,\\njust like almost any other programming language, is the abil ity to create new types. F or the\\nmost part, this is done by deﬁning new classes; you will learn how to do that in Chapter 5. But\\nwe will look here at one particular case: the ability to deﬁne enums (short for enumerated\\ntypes). Enums are a recent addition to Java. They were only added in V ersion 5.0. Many\\nprogramming languages have something similar, and many peo ple believe that enums should\\nhave been part of Java from the beginning.\\nT echnically , an enum is considered to be a special kind of cla ss, but that is not important\\nfor now. In this section, we will look at enums in a simpliﬁed f orm. In practice, most uses of\\nenums will only need the simpliﬁed form that is presented her e.'),\n",

OBJECTS AND SUBROUTINES 35\\nAn enum is a type that has a ﬁxed list of possible values, which is speciﬁed when the enum\\nis created. In some ways, an enum is similar to the boolean data type, which has true and\\nfalse as its only possible values. However, boolean is a primitive type, while an enum is not.\\nThe deﬁnition of an enum types has the (simpliﬁed) form:\\nenum ⟨enum-type-name ⟩ { ⟨list-of-enum-values ⟩ }\\nThis deﬁnition cannot be inside a subroutine. Y ou can place i t outside the main() routine\\nof the program. The ⟨enum-type-name⟩ can be any simple identiﬁer. This identiﬁer becomes\\nthe name of the enum type, in the same way that “boolean” is the name of the boolean type\\nand “String” is the name of the String type. Each value in the ⟨list-of-enum-values⟩ must be a\\nsimple identiﬁer, and the identiﬁers in the list are separat ed by commas. F or example, here is\\nthe deﬁnition of an enum type named Season whose values are the names of the four seasons\\nof the year:\\nenum Season { SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER }\\nBy convention, enum values are given names that are made up of upper case letters, but\\nthat is a style guideline and not a syntax rule. Enum values ar e not variables. Each value is\\na constant that always has the same value. In fact, the possible values o f an enum type are\\nusually referred to as enum constants .\\nNote that the enum constants of type Season are considered to be “contained in” Season,\\nwhich means—following the convention that compound identi ﬁers are used for things that are\\ncontained in other things—the names that you actually use in your program to refer to them\\nare Season.SPRING, Season.SUMMER, Season.FALL, and Season.WINTER.\\nOnce an enum type has been created, it can be used to declare va riables in exactly the same\\nways that other types are used. F or example, you can declare a variable named vacation of\\ntype Season with the statement:\\nSeason vacation;\\nAfter declaring the variable, you can assign a value to it usi ng an assignment statement. The\\nvalue on the right-hand side of the assignment can be one of th e enum constants of type Season.\\nRemember to use the full name of the constant, including “Sea son”! F or example:\\nvacation = Season.SUMMER;\\nY ou can print out an enum value with an output statement such a s System.out.print(vacation).\\nThe output value will be the name of the enum constant (withou t the “Season.”). In this case,\\nthe output would be “SUMMER”.\\nBecause an enum is technically a class, the enum values are te chnically objects. As ob-\\njects, they can contain subroutines. One of the subroutines in every enum value is named\\nordinal(). When used with an enum value, it returns the ordinal number of the value in\\nthe list of values of the enum. The ordinal number simply tell s the position of the value in\\nthe list. That is, Season.SPRING.ordinal() is the int value 0, Season.SUMMER.ordinal() is\\n1, Season.FALL.ordinal() is 2, and Season.WINTER.ordinal() is 3. (Y ou will see over and\\nover again that computer scientists like to start counting a t zero!) Y ou can, of course, use\\nthe ordinal() method with a variable of type Season, such as vacation.ordinal() in our\\nexample.\\nRight now, it might not seem to you that enums are all that usef ul. As you work though\\nthe rest of the book, you should be convinced that they are. F o r now, you should at least\\nappreciate them as the ﬁrst example of an important concept: creating new types. Here is a\\nlittle example that shows enums being used in a complete prog ram:'),\n",

Y ou’ve already seen that output can b e displayed to the user\\nusing the subroutine System.out.print. This subroutine is part of a pre-deﬁned object called\\nSystem.out. The purpose of this object is precisely to display output to the user. There is\\na corresponding object called System.in that exists to read data input by the user, but it\\nprovides only very primitive input facilities, and it requi res some advanced Java programming\\nskills to use it eﬀectively .\\nJava 5.0 ﬁnally makes input a little easier with a new Scanner class. However, it requires\\nsome knowledge of object-oriented programming to use this c lass, so it’s not appropriate for\\nuse here at the beginning of this course. (F urthermore, in my opinion, Scanner still does not\\nget things quite right.)\\nThere is some excuse for this lack of concern with input, sinc e Java is meant mainly to\\nwrite programs for Graphical User Interfaces, and those pro grams have their own style of\\ninput/output, which is implemented in Java. However, basic support is needed for in put/output\\nin old-fashioned non-GUI programs. F ortunately , it is poss ible to extend Java by creating new\\nclasses that provide subroutines that are not available in t he standard part of the language.\\nAs soon as a new class is available, the subroutines that it co ntains can be used in exactly the\\nsame way as built-in routines.'),\n",

TEXT INPUT AND OUTPUT 37\\nAlong these lines, I’ve written a class called T extIO that deﬁnes subroutines for reading\\nvalues typed by the user of a non-GUI program. The subroutine s in this class make it possible\\nto get input from the standard input object, System.in, without knowing about the advanced\\naspects of Java that are needed to use Scanner or to use System.in directly . T extIO also\\ncontains a set of output subroutines. The output subroutine s are similar to those provided in\\nSystem.out, but they provide a few additional features. Y ou can use whic hever set of output\\nsubroutines you prefer, and you can even mix them in the same p rogram.\\nT o use the T extIO class, you must make sure that the class is available to your p rogram.\\nWhat this means depends on the Java programming environment that you are using. In general,\\nyou just have to add the source code ﬁle, TextIO.java, to the same directory that contains your\\nmain program. See Section 2.6 for more information about how to use T extIO.\\n2.4.1 A First T ext Input Example\\nThe input routines in the T extIO class are static member functions. (Static member function s\\nwere introduced in the previous section.) Let’s suppose tha t you want your program to read\\nan integer typed in by the user. The T extIO class contains a static member function named\\ngetlnInt that you can use for this purpose. Since this function is cont ained in the T extIO class,\\nyou have to refer to it in your program as TextIO.getlnInt. The function has no parameters,\\nso a complete call to the function takes the form “ TextIO.getlnInt()”. This function call\\nrepresents the int value typed by the user, and you have to do something with the r eturned\\nvalue, such as assign it to a variable. F or example, if userInput is a variable of type int\\n(created with a declaration statement “ int userInput;”), then you could use the assignment\\nstatement\\nuserInput = TextIO.getlnInt();\\nWhen the computer executes this statement, it will wait for t he user to type in an integer\\nvalue. The value typed will be returned by the function, and i t will be stored in the variable,\\nuserInput. Here is a complete program that uses TextIO.getlnInt to read a number typed\\nby the user and then prints out the square of the number that th e user types:\\n/**\\n* A program that reads an integer that is typed in by the\\n* user and computes and prints the square of that integer.\\n*/\\npublic class PrintSquare {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nint userInput; // The number input by the user.\\nint square; // The userInput, multiplied by itself.\\nSystem.out.print(\"Please type a number: \");\\nuserInput = TextIO.getlnInt();\\nsquare = userInput * userInput;\\nSystem.out.print(\"The square of that number is \");\\nSystem.out.println(square);\\n} // end of main()\\n} //end of class PrintSquare'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\nWhen you run this program, it will display the message “Pleas e type a number:” and will\\npause until you type a response, including a carriage return after the number.\\n2.4.2 T ext Output\\nThe T extIO class contains static member subroutines TextIO.put and TextIO.putln that can\\nbe used in the same way as System.out.print and System.out.println. F or example, al-\\nthough there is no particular advantage in doing so in this ca se, you could replace the two\\nlines\\nSystem.out.print(\"The square of that number is \");\\nSystem.out.println(square);\\nwith\\nTextIO.put(\"The square of that number is \");\\nTextIO.putln(square);\\nF or the next few chapters, I will use T extIO for input in all my examples, and I will often use\\nit for output. Keep in mind that T extIO can only be used in a program if it is available to that\\nprogram. It is not built into Java in the way that the System class is.\\nLet’s look a little more closely at the built-in output subro utines System.out.print and\\nSystem.out.println. Each of these subroutines can be used with one parameter, wh ere the\\nparameter can be a value of any of the primitive types byte, short, int, long, ﬂoat , double, char,\\nor boolean. The parameter can also be a String, a value belonging to an enum type, or indeed\\nany object. That is, you can say “ System.out.print(x);” or “ System.out.println(x);”,\\nwhere x is any expression whose value is of any type whatsoever. The e xpression can be a con-\\nstant, a variable, or even something more complicated such a s 2*distance*time. Now, in fact,\\nthe System class actually includes several diﬀerent subroutines to ha ndle diﬀerent parameter\\ntypes. There is one System.out.print for printing values of type double, one for values of\\ntype int, another for values that are objects, and so on. These subrou tines can have the same\\nname since the computer can tell which one you mean in a given s ubroutine call statement,\\ndepending on the type of parameter that you supply . Having se veral subroutines of the same\\nname that diﬀer in the types of their parameters is called overloading. Many programming\\nlanguages do not permit overloading, but it is common in Java programs.\\nThe diﬀerence between System.out.print and System.out.println is that the println\\nversion outputs a carriage return after it outputs the speci ﬁed parameter value. There is a\\nversion of System.out.println that has no parameters. This version simply outputs a carria ge\\nreturn, and nothing else. A subroutine call statement for th is version of the program looks like\\n“ System.out.println();”, with empty parentheses. Note that “ System.out.println(x);” is\\nexactly equivalent to “ System.out.print(x); System.out.println();”; the carriage return\\ncomes after the value of x. (There is no version of System.out.print without parameters.\\nDo you see why?)\\nAs mentioned above, the T extIO subroutines TextIO.put and TextIO.putln can be used\\nas replacements for System.out.print and System.out.println. The T extIO functions work\\nin exactly the same way as the System functions, except that, as we will see below, T extIO can\\nalso be used to write to other destinations.'),\n",

TEXT INPUT AND OUTPUT 39\\n2.4.3 T extIO Input F unctions\\nThe T extIO class is a little more versatile at doing output than is System.out. However, it’s\\ninput for which we really need it.\\nWith T extIO, input is done using functions. F or example, TextIO.getlnInt(), which was\\ndiscussed above, makes the user type in a value of type int and returns that input value so that\\nyou can use it in your program. T extIO includes several functions for reading diﬀerent types of\\ninput values. Here are examples of the ones that you are most l ikely to use:\\nj = TextIO.getlnInt(); // Reads a value of type int.\\ny = TextIO.getlnDouble(); // Reads a value of type double.\\na = TextIO.getlnBoolean(); // Reads a value of type boolean.\\nc = TextIO.getlnChar(); // Reads a value of type char.\\nw = TextIO.getlnWord(); // Reads one \"word\" as a value of type String.\\ns = TextIO.getln(); // Reads an entire input line as a String.\\nF or these statements to be legal, the variables on the left si de of each assignment statement\\nmust already be declared and must be of the same type as that re turned by the function on\\nthe right side. Note carefully that these functions do not ha ve parameters. The values that\\nthey return come from outside the program, typed in by the use r as the program is running.\\nT o “capture” that data so that you can use it in your program, y ou have to assign the return\\nvalue of the function to a variable. Y ou will then be able to re fer to the user’s input value by\\nusing the name of the variable.\\nWhen you call one of these functions, you are guaranteed that it will return a legal value of\\nthe correct type. If the user types in an illegal value as inpu t—for example, if you ask for an\\nint and the user types in a non-numeric character or a number that is outside the legal range\\nof values that can be stored in in a variable of type int—then the computer will ask the user to\\nre-enter the value, and your program never sees the ﬁrst, ill egal value that the user entered. F or\\nTextIO.getlnBoolean(), the user is allowed to type in any of the following: true, fal se, t, f, yes,\\nno, y , n, 1, or 0. F urthermore, they can use either upper or low er case letters. In any case, the\\nuser’s input is interpreted as a true/false value. It’s conv enient to use TextIO.getlnBoolean()\\nto read the user’s response to a Y es/No question.\\nY ou’ll notice that there are two input functions that return Strings. The ﬁrst, getlnWord(),\\nreturns a string consisting of non-blank characters only . W hen it is called, it skips over any\\nspaces and carriage returns typed in by the user. Then it read s non-blank characters until it gets\\nto the next space or carriage return. It returns a String consisting of all the non-blank characters\\nthat it has read. The second input function, getln(), simply returns a string consisting of all\\nthe characters typed in by the user, including spaces, up to t he next carriage return. It gets an\\nentire line of input text. The carriage return itself is not r eturned as part of the input string,\\nbut it is read and discarded by the computer. Note that the Str ing returned by this function\\nmight be the empty string , \"\", which contains no characters at all. Y ou will get this retur n\\nvalue if the user simply presses return, without typing anyt hing else ﬁrst.\\nAll the other input functions listed— getlnInt(), getlnDouble(), getlnBoolean(), and\\ngetlnChar()—behave like getWord() in that they will skip past any blanks and carriage returns\\nin the input before reading a value.\\nF urthermore, if the user types extra characters on the line a fter the input value, all the\\nextra characters will be discarded, along with the carriage return at the end of the\\nline.

T extIO provides the following alternative input\\nfunctions to allow you to do this:\\nj = TextIO.getInt(); // Reads a value of type int.\\ny = TextIO.getDouble(); // Reads a value of type double.\\na = TextIO.getBoolean(); // Reads a value of type boolean.\\nc = TextIO.getChar(); // Reads a value of type char.\\nw = TextIO.getWord(); // Reads one \"word\" as a value of type St ring.\\nThe names of these functions start with “get” instead of “get ln”. “Getln” is short for “get\\nline” and should remind you that the functions whose names be gin with “getln” will get an\\nentire line of data. A function without the “ln” will read an i nput value in the same way , but\\nwill then save the rest of the input line in a chunk of internal memory called the input buﬀer .\\nThe next time the computer wants to read an input value, it wil l look in the input buﬀer before\\nprompting the user for input. This allows the computer to rea d several values from one line\\nof the user’s input. Strictly speaking, the computer actual ly reads only from the input buﬀer.\\nThe ﬁrst time the program tries to read input from the user, th e computer will wait while the\\nuser types in an entire line of input. T extIO stores that line in the input buﬀer until the data\\non the line has been read or discarded (by one of the “getln” fu nctions). The user only gets to\\ntype when the buﬀer is empty .\\nClearly , the semantics of input is much more complicated tha n the semantics of output!\\nF ortunately , for the majority of applications, it’s pretty straightforward in practice. Y ou only\\nneed to follow the details if you want to do something fancy . I n particular, I strongly advise\\nyou to use the “getln” versions of the input routines, rather than the “get” versions, unless you\\nreally want to read several items from the same line of input, precisely because the semantics\\nof the “getln” versions is much simpler.\\nNote, by the way , that although the T extIO input functions will skip past blank spaces and\\ncarriage returns while looking for input, they will not skip past other characters. F or example,\\nif you try to read two ints and the user types “2,3”, the computer will read the ﬁrst num ber\\ncorrectly , but when it tries to read the second number, it wil l see the comma. It will regard this\\nas an error and will force the user to retype the number. If you want to input several numbers\\nfrom one line, you should make sure that the user knows to sepa rate them with spaces, not\\ncommas. Alternatively , if you want to require a comma betwee n the numbers, use getChar()\\nto read the comma before reading the second number.\\nThere is another character input function, TextIO.getAnyChar(), which does not skip past\\nblanks or carriage returns. It simply reads and returns the n ext character typed by the user,\\neven if it’s a blank or carriage return. If the user typed a car riage return, then the char returned\\nby getAnyChar() is the special linefeed character ’ \\\\n’. There is also a function, TextIO.peek(),\\nthat lets you look ahead at the next character in the input wit hout actually reading it. After\\nyou “peek” at the next character, it will still be there when y ou read the next item from input.\\nThis allows you to look ahead and see what’s coming up in the in put, so that you can take\\ndiﬀerent actions depending on what’s there.\\nThe T extIO class provides a number of other functions. T o learn more abo ut them, you can\\nlook at the comments in the source code ﬁle, TextIO.java.\\n(Y ou might be wondering why there are only two output routine s, print and println,\\nwhich can output data values of any type, while there is a sepa rate input routine for each data\\ntype. As noted above, in reality there are many print and println routines, one for each data\\ntype. The computer can tell them apart based on the type of the parameter that you provide.\\nHowever, the input routines don’t have parameters, so the di ﬀerent input routines can only be'),\n",

A lot of formatt ing options are available. I will\\ncover just a few of the simplest and most commonly used possib ilities here.\\nY ou can use the function System.out.printf to produce formatted output. (The name\\n“printf,” which stands for “print formatted,” is copied fro m the C and C++ programming\\nlanguages, which have always have a similar formatting capa bility). System.out.printf takes\\ntwo or more parameters. The ﬁrst parameter is a String that speciﬁes the format of the output.\\nThis parameter is called the format string . The remaining parameters specify the values that'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\nare to be output. Here is a statement that will print a number i n the proper format for a dollar\\namount, where amount is a variable of type double:\\nSystem.out.printf( \"%1.2f\", amount );\\nT extIO can also do formatted output. The function TextIO.putf has the same\\nfunctionality as System.out.printf. Using T extIO, the above example would be:\\nTextIO.printf(\"%1.2\",amount); and you could say TextIO.putln(\"%1.2f\",principal);\\ninstead of TextIO.putln(principal); in the Interest2 program to get the output in the\\nright format.\\nThe output format of a value is speciﬁed by a format speciﬁer . The format string (in\\nthe simple cases that I cover here) contains one format speci ﬁer for each of the values that is\\nto be output. Some typical format speciﬁers are %d, %12d, %10s, %1.2f, %15.8e and %1.8g.\\nEvery format speciﬁer begins with a percent sign ( %) and ends with a letter, possibly with some\\nextra formatting information in between. The letter speciﬁ es the type of output that is to be\\nproduced. F or example, in %d and %12d, the “d” speciﬁes that an integer is to be written. The\\n“12” in %12d speciﬁes the minimum number of spaces that should be used for the output. If\\nthe integer that is being output takes up fewer than 12 spaces , extra blank spaces are added\\nin front of the integer to bring the total up to 12. W e say that t he output is “right-justiﬁed\\nin a ﬁeld of length 12.” The value is not forced into 12 spaces; if the value has more than 12\\ndigits, all the digits will be printed, with no extra spaces. The speciﬁer %d means the same as\\n%1d; that is an integer will be printed using just as many spaces a s necessary . (The “d,” by the\\nway , stands for “decimal” (base-10) numbers. Y ou can use an “ x” to output an integer value\\nin hexadecimal form.)\\nThe letter “s” at the end of a format speciﬁer can be used with a ny type of value. It\\nmeans that the value should be output in its default format, j ust as it would be in unformatted\\noutput. A number, such as the “10” in %10s can be added to specify the (minimum) number\\nof characters. The “s” stands for “string,” meaning that the value is converted into a String\\nvalue in the usual way .\\nThe format speciﬁers for values of type double are even more complicated. An “f”, as\\nin %1.2f, is used to output a number in “ﬂoating-point” form, that is w ith digits after the\\ndecimal point. In %1.2f, the “2” speciﬁes the number of digits to use after the decima l point.\\nThe “1” speciﬁes the (minimum) number of characters to outpu t, which eﬀectively means that\\njust as many characters as are necessary should be used. Simi larly , %12.3f would specify a\\nﬂoating-point format with 3 digits after the decimal point, right-justiﬁed in a ﬁeld of length 12.\\nV ery large and very small numbers should be written in expone ntial format, such as\\n6.00221415e23, representing “6.00221415 times 10 raised t o the power 23.” A format speci-\\nﬁer such as %15.8e speciﬁes an output in exponential form, with the “8” telling how many\\ndigits to use after the decimal point. If you use “g” instead o f “e”, the output will be in\\nﬂoating-point form for small values and in exponential form for large values. In %1.8g, the\\n8 gives the total number of digits in the answer, including bo th the digits before the decimal\\npoint and the digits after the decimal point.\\nIn addition to format speciﬁers, the format string in a printf statement can include other\\ncharacters. These extra characters are just copied to the ou tput. This can be a convenient way\\nto insert values into the middle of an output string. F or exam ple, if x and y are variables of\\ntype int, you could say\\nSystem.out.printf(\"The product of %d and %d is %d\", x, y, x*y);\\nWhen this statement is executed, the value of x is substituted for the ﬁrst %d in the string, the'),\n",

F or exa mple, data can be written to a ﬁle\\nthat is stored on the user’s hard drive. The advantage to this , of course, is that the data is\\nsaved in the ﬁle even after the program ends, and the user can p rint the ﬁle, email it to someone\\nelse, edit it with another program, and so on.\\nT extIO has the ability to write data to ﬁles and to read data from ﬁles . When you write\\noutput using the put, putln, or putf method in T extIO, the output is sent to the current\\noutput destination. By default, the current output destination is standard outp ut. However,\\nT extIO has some subroutines that can be used to change the current ou tput destination. T o\\nwrite to a ﬁle named “result.txt”, for example, you would use the statement:\\nTextIO.writeFile(\"result.txt\");\\nAfter this statement is executed, any output from T extIO output statements will be sent to the\\nﬁle named “result.txt” instead of to standard output. The ﬁl e should be created in the same\\ndirectory that contains the program. Note that if a ﬁle with t he same name already exists, its\\nprevious contents will be erased! In many cases, you want to l et the user select the ﬁle that\\nwill be used for output. The statement\\nTextIO.writeUserSelectedFile();\\nwill open a typical graphical-user-interface ﬁle selectio n dialog where the user can specify the\\noutput ﬁle. If you want to go back to sending output to standar d output, you can say\\nTextIO.writeStandardOutput();\\nY ou can also specify the input source for TextIO’s various “get” functions. The default input\\nsource is standard input. Y ou can use the statement TextIO.readFile(\"data.txt\") to read\\nfrom a ﬁle named “data.txt” instead, or you can let the user se lect the input ﬁle by saying\\nTextIO.readUserSelectedFile(), and you can go back to reading from standard input with\\nTextIO.readStandardInput().\\nWhen your program is reading from standard input, the user ge ts a chance to correct any\\nerrors in the input. This is not possible when the program is r eading from a ﬁle. If illegal data\\nis found when a program tries to read from a ﬁle, an error occur s that will crash the program.\\n(Later, we will see that is is possible to “catch” such errors and recover from them.) Errors can\\nalso occur, though more rarely , when writing to ﬁles.\\nA complete understanding of ﬁle input/output in Java requir es a knowledge of object ori-\\nented programming. W e will return to the topic later, in Chap ter 11. The ﬁle I/O capabilities\\nin T extIO are rather primitive by comparison. Nevertheless, they are suﬃcient for many appli-\\ncations, and they will allow you to get some experience with ﬁ les sooner rather than later.\\nAs a simple example, here is a program that asks the user some q uestions and outputs the\\nuser’s responses to a ﬁle named “proﬁle.txt”:\\npublic class CreateProfile {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {'),\n",

Recall that an expression is a piece of\\nprogram code that represents or computes a value. An express ion can be a literal, a variable,\\na function call, or several of these things combined with ope rators such as + and >. The value\\nof an expression can be assigned to a variable, used as a param eter in a subroutine call, or\\ncombined with other values into a more complicated expressi on. (The value can even, in some\\ncases, be ignored, if that’s what you want to do; this is more c ommon than you might think.)\\nExpressions are an essential part of programming. So far, th ese notes have dealt only informally\\nwith expressions. This section tells you the more-or-less c omplete story (leaving out some of\\nthe less commonly used operators).\\nThe basic building blocks of expressions are literals (such as 674, 3.14, true, and ’X’),\\nvariables, and function calls. Recall that a function is a su broutine that returns a value. Y ou’ve\\nalready seen some examples of functions, such as the input ro utines from the T extIO class and\\nthe mathematical functions from the Math class.'),\n",

DET AILS OF EXPRESSIONS 45\\nThe Math class also contains a couple of mathematical constants that are useful in math-\\nematical expressions: Math.PI represents π (the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its\\ndiameter), and Math.E represents e (the base of the natural logarithms). These “constants”\\nare actually member variables in Math of type double. They are only approximations for the\\nmathematical constants, which would require an inﬁnite num ber of digits to specify exactly .\\nLiterals, variables, and function calls are simple express ions. More complex expressions\\ncan be built up by using operators to combine simpler expressions. Operators include + for\\nadding two numbers, > for comparing two values, and so on. When several operators a ppear\\nin an expression, there is a question of precedence, which determines how the operators are\\ngrouped for evaluation. F or example, in the expression “ A + B * C”, B*C is computed ﬁrst\\nand then the result is added to A. W e say that multiplication ( *) has higher precedence\\nthan addition ( +). If the default precedence is not what you want, you can use p arentheses to\\nexplicitly specify the grouping you want. F or example, you c ould use “ (A + B) * C” if you\\nwant to add A to B ﬁrst and then multiply the result by C.\\nThe rest of this section gives details of operators in Java. T he number of operators in Java\\nis quite large, and I will not cover them all here. Most of the i mportant ones are here; a few\\nwill be covered in later chapters as they become relevant.\\n2.5.1 Arithmetic Operators\\nArithmetic operators include addition, subtraction, mult iplication, and division. They are\\nindicated by +, -, *, and /. These operations can be used on values of any numeric type:\\nbyte, short, int, long, ﬂoat , or double. When the computer actually calculates one of these\\noperations, the two values that it combines must be of the sam e type. If your program tells\\nthe computer to combine two values of diﬀerent types, the com puter will convert one of the\\nvalues from one type to another. F or example, to compute 37.4 + 10, the computer will convert\\nthe integer 10 to a real number 10.0 and will then compute 37.4 + 10.0. This is called a type\\nconversion. Ordinarily , you don’t have to worry about type conversion i n expressions, because\\nthe computer does it automatically .\\nWhen two numerical values are combined (after doing type con version on one of them, if\\nnecessary), the answer will be of the same type. If you multip ly two ints, you get an int; if you\\nmultiply two doubles, you get a double. This is what you would expect, but you have to be\\nvery careful when you use the division operator /. When you divide two integers, the answer\\nwill always be an integer; if the quotient has a fractional pa rt, it is discarded. F or example, the\\nvalue of 7/2 is 3, not 3.5. If N is an integer variable, then N/100 is an integer, and 1/N is equal\\nto zero for any N greater than one! This fact is a common source of programming errors. Y ou\\ncan force the computer to compute a real number as the answer b y making one of the operands\\nreal: F or example, when the computer evaluates 1.0/N, it ﬁrst converts N to a real number in\\norder to match the type of 1.0, so you get a real number as the answer.\\nJava also has an operator for computing the remainder when on e integer is divided by\\nanother. This operator is indicated by %. If A and B are integers, then A % B represents the\\nremainder when A is divided by B. (However, for negative operands, % is not quite the same as\\nthe usual mathematical “modulus” operator, since if one of A or B is negative, then the value\\nof A % B will be negative.) F or example, 7 % 2 is 1, while 34577 % 100 is 77, and 50 % 8 is\\n2. A common use of % is to test whether a given integer is even or odd. N is even if N % 2 is\\nzero, and it is odd if N % 2 is 1. More generally , you can check whether an integer N is evenly\\ndivisible by an integer M by checking whether N % M is zero.\\nFinally , you might need the unary minus operator, which takes the negative of a number.'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\nF or example, -X has the same value as (-1)*X. F or completeness, Java also has a unary plus\\noperator, as in +X, even though it doesn’t really do anything.\\nBy the way , recall that the + operator can also be used to concatenate a value of any\\ntype onto a String. This is another example of type conversion. In Java, any typ e can be\\nautomatically converted into type String.\\n2.5.2 Increment and Decrement\\nY ou’ll ﬁnd that adding 1 to a variable is an extremely common operation in programmin g.\\nSubtracting 1 from a variable is also pretty common. Y ou might perform the o peration of\\nadding 1 to a variable with assignment statements such as:\\ncounter = counter + 1;\\ngoalsScored = goalsScored + 1;\\nThe eﬀect of the assignment statement x = x + 1 is to take the old value of the variable\\nx, compute the result of adding 1 to that value, and store the answer as the new value of\\nx. The same operation can be accomplished by writing x++ (or, if you prefer, ++x). This\\nactually changes the value of x, so that it has the same eﬀect as writing “ x = x + 1”. The two\\nstatements above could be written\\ncounter++;\\ngoalsScored++;\\nSimilarly , you could write x-- (or --x) to subtract 1 from x. That is, x-- performs the same\\ncomputation as x = x - 1. Adding 1 to a variable is called incrementing that variable,\\nand subtracting 1 is called decrementing. The operators ++ and -- are called the increment\\noperator and the decrement operator, respectively . These o perators can be used on variables\\nbelonging to any of the numerical types and also on variables of type char.\\nUsually , the operators ++ or -- are used in statements like “ x++;” or “ x--;”. These state-\\nments are commands to change the value of x. However, it is also legal to use x++, ++x, x--,\\nor --x as expressions, or as parts of larger expressions. That is, y ou can write things like:\\ny = x++;\\ny = ++x;\\nTextIO.putln(--x);\\nz = (++x) * (y--);\\nThe statement “ y = x++;” has the eﬀects of adding 1 to the value of x and, in addition, assigning\\nsome value to y. The value assigned to y is the value of the expression x++, which is deﬁned\\nto be the old value of x, before the 1 is added. Thus, if the value of x is 6, the statement “ y\\n= x++;” will change the value of x to 7, but it will change the value of y to 6 since the value\\nassigned to y is the old value of x. On the other hand, the value of ++x is deﬁned to be the\\nnew value of x, after the 1 is added. So if x is 6, then the statement “ y = ++x;” changes the\\nvalues of both x and y to 7. The decrement operator, --, works in a similar way .\\nThis can be confusing. My advice is: Don’t be confused. Use ++ and -- only in stand-alone\\nstatements, not in expressions. I will follow this advice in all the examples in these notes.\\n2.5.3 Relational Operators\\nJava has boolean variables and boolean-valued expressions that can be used to express con-\\nditions that can be either true or false.

DET AILS OF EXPRESSIONS 47\\nto compare two values using a relational operator . Relational operators are used to test\\nwhether two values are equal, whether one value is greater th an another, and so forth. The\\nrelational operators in Java are: ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=. The meanings of these operators are:\\nA == B Is A \"equal to\" B?\\nA != B Is A \"not equal to\" B?\\nA < B Is A \"less than\" B?\\nA > B Is A \"greater than\" B?\\nA <= B Is A \"less than or equal to\" B?\\nA >= B Is A \"greater than or equal to\" B?\\nThese operators can be used to compare values of any of the num eric types. They can also be\\nused to compare values of type char. F or characters, < and > are deﬁned according the numeric\\nUnicode values of the characters. (This might not always be w hat you want. It is not the same\\nas alphabetical order because all the upper case letters com e before all the lower case letters.)\\nWhen using boolean expressions, you should remember that as far as the computer is con-\\ncerned, there is nothing special about boolean values. In th e next chapter, you will see how to\\nuse them in loop and branch statements. But you can also assig n boolean-valued expressions\\nto boolean variables, just as you can assign numeric values t o numeric variables.\\nBy the way , the operators == and != can be used to compare boolean values. This is\\noccasionally useful. F or example, can you ﬁgure out what thi s does:\\nboolean sameSign;\\nsameSign = ((x > 0) == (y > 0));\\nOne thing that you cannot do with the relational operators <, >, <=, and <= is to use them\\nto compare values of type String. Y ou can legally use == and != to compare Strings, but\\nbecause of peculiarities in the way objects behave, they mig ht not give the results you want.\\n(The == operator checks whether two objects are stored in the same me mory location, rather\\nthan whether they contain the same value. Occasionally , for some objects, you do want to make\\nsuch a check—but rarely for strings. I’ll get back to this in a later chapter.) Instead, you should\\nuse the subroutines equals(), equalsIgnoreCase(), and compareTo(), which were described\\nin Section 2.3, to compare two Strings.\\n2.5.4 Boolean Operators\\nIn English, complicated conditions can be formed using the w ords “and”, “or”, and “not.” F or\\nexample, “If there is a test and you did not study for it. . . ”. “And”, “or”, and “not” are\\nboolean operators , and they exist in Java as well as in English.\\nIn Java, the boolean operator “and” is represented by &&. The && operator is used to\\ncombine two boolean values. The result is also a boolean valu e. The result is true if both\\nof the combined values are true, and the result is false if either of the combined values is\\nfalse. F or example, “ (x == 0) && (y == 0)” is true if and only if both x is equal to 0 and\\ny is equal to 0.\\nThe boolean operator “or” is represented by ||. (That’s supposed to be two of the vertical\\nline characters, |.) The expression “ A || B” is true if either A is true or B is true, or if both\\nare true. “ A || B” is false only if both A and B are false.\\nThe operators && and || are said to be short-circuited versions of the boolean operators.\\nThis means that the second operand of && or || is not necessarily evaluated. Consider the test\\n(x != 0) && (y/x > 1)'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\nSuppose that the value of x is in fact zero. In that case, the division y/x is undeﬁned math-\\nmatically . However, the computer will never perform the div ision, since when the computer\\nevaluates (x != 0), it ﬁnds that the result is false, and so it knows that ( (x != 0) && any-\\nthing) has to be false. Therefore, it doesn’t bother to evaluate th e second operand, (y/x > 1).\\nThe evaluation has been short-circuited and the division by zero is avoided. Without the short-\\ncircuiting, there would have been a division by zero. (This m ay seem like a technicality , and it\\nis. But at times, it will make your programming life a little e asier.)\\nThe boolean operator “not” is a unary operator. In Java, it is indicated by ! and is written\\nin front of its single operand. F or example, if test is a boolean variable, then\\ntest = ! test;\\nwill reverse the value of test, changing it from true to false, or from false to true.\\n2.5.5 Conditional Operator\\nAny good programming language has some nifty little feature s that aren’t really necessary but\\nthat let you feel cool when you use them. Java has the conditio nal operator. It’s a ternary\\noperator—that is, it has three operands—and it comes in two p ieces, ? and :, that have to be\\nused together. It takes the form\\n⟨boolean-expression ⟩ ? ⟨expression1 ⟩ : ⟨expression2 ⟩\\nThe computer tests the value of ⟨boolean-expression⟩. If the value is true, it evaluates\\n⟨expression1⟩; otherwise, it evaluates ⟨expression2⟩. F or example:\\nnext = (N % 2 == 0) ? (N/2) : (3*N+1);\\nwill assign the value N/2 to next if N is even (that is, if N % 2 == 0 is true), and it will assign\\nthe value (3*N+1) to next if N is odd. (The parentheses in this example are not required, bu t\\nthey do make the expression easier to read.)\\n2.5.6 Assignment Operators and Type-Casts\\nY ou are already familiar with the assignment statement, whi ch uses the symbol “=” to assign\\nthe value of an expression to a variable. In fact, = is really a n operator in the sense that an\\nassignment can itself be used as an expression or as part of a m ore complex expression. The\\nvalue of an assignment such as A=B is the same as the value that is assigned to A. So, if you\\nwant to assign the value of B to A and test at the same time whether that value is zero, you\\ncould say:\\nif ( (A=B) == 0 )...\\nUsually , I would say , don’t do things like that !\\nIn general, the type of the expression on the right-hand side of an assignment statement\\nmust be the same as the type of the variable on the left-hand si de. However, in some cases,\\nthe computer will automatically convert the value computed by the expression to match the\\ntype of the variable. Consider the list of numeric types: byte, short, int, long, ﬂoat , double.\\nA value of a type that occurs earlier in this list can be conver ted automatically to a value that\\noccurs later. F or example:\\nint A;\\ndouble X;\\nshort B;'),\n",

DET AILS OF EXPRESSIONS 49\\nA = 17;\\nX = A; // OK; A is converted to a double\\nB = A; // illegal; no automatic conversion\\n// from int to short\\nThe idea is that conversion should only be done automaticall y when it can be done without\\nchanging the semantics of the value. Any int can be converted to a double with the same\\nnumeric value. However, there are int values that lie outside the legal range of shorts. There\\nis simply no way to represent the int 100000 as a short, for example, since the largest value of\\ntype short is 32767.\\nIn some cases, you might want to force a conversion that would n’t be done automatically .\\nF or this, you can use what is called a type cast . A type cast is indicated by putting a type\\nname, in parentheses, in front of the value you want to conver t. F or example,\\nint A;\\nshort B;\\nA = 17;\\nB = (short)A; // OK; A is explicitly type cast\\n// to a value of type short\\nY ou can do type casts from any numeric type to any other numeri c type. However, you should\\nnote that you might change the numeric value of a number by typ e-casting it. F or example,\\n(short)100000 is -31072. (The -31072 is obtained by taking the 4-byte int 100000 and throwing\\naway two of those bytes to obtain a short—you’ve lost the real information that was in those\\ntwo bytes.)\\nAs another example of type casts, consider the problem of get ting a random integer between\\n1 and 6. The function Math.random() gives a real number between 0.0 and 0.9999. . . , and so\\n6*Math.random() is between 0.0 and 5.999. . . . The type-cast operator, (int), can be used to\\nconvert this to an integer: (int)(6*Math.random()). A real number is cast to an integer by\\ndiscarding the fractional part. Thus, (int)(6*Math.random()) is one of the integers 0, 1, 2, 3,\\n4, and 5. T o get a number between 1 and 6, we can add 1: “ (int)(6*Math.random()) + 1”.\\nY ou can also type-cast between the type char and the numeric types. The numeric value\\nof a char is its Unicode code number. F or example, (char)97 is ’a’, and (int)’+’ is 43.\\n(However, a type conversion from char to int is automatic and does not have to be indicated\\nwith an explicit type cast.)\\nJava has several variations on the assignment operator, whi ch exist to save typing. F or\\nexample, “ A += B” is deﬁned to be the same as “ A = A + B”. Every operator in Java that\\napplies to two operands gives rise to a similar assignment op erator. F or example:\\nx -= y; // same as: x = x - y;\\nx *= y; // same as: x = x * y;\\nx /= y; // same as: x = x / y;\\nx %= y; // same as: x = x % y; (for integers x and y)\\nq &&= p; // same as: q = q && p; (for booleans q and p)\\nThe combined assignment operator += even works with strings. Recall that when the + operator\\nis used with a string as one of the operands, it represents con catenation. Since str += x is\\nequivalent to str = str + x, when += is used with a string on the left-hand side, it appends\\nthe value on the right-hand side onto the string. F or example , if str has the value “tire”, then\\nthe statement str += ’d’; changes the value of str to “tired”.'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\n2.5.7 Type Conversion of Strings\\nIn addition to automatic type conversions and explicit type casts, there are some other cases\\nwhere you might want to convert a value of one type into a value of a diﬀerent type. One\\ncommon example is the conversion of a String value into some other type, such as converting\\nthe string \"10\" into the int value 10 or the string \"17.42e-2\" into the double value 0.1742. In\\nJava, these conversions are handled by built-in functions.\\nThere is a standard class named Integer that contains several subroutines and variables\\nrelated to the int data type. (Recall that since int is not a class, int itself can’t contain\\nany subroutines or variables.) In particular, if str is any expression of type String, then\\nInteger.parseInt(str) is a function call that attempts to convert the value of str into a\\nvalue of type int. F or example, the value of Integer.parseInt(\"10\") is the int value 10. If\\nthe parameter to Integer.parseInt does not represent a legal int value, then an error occurs.\\nSimilarly , the standard class named Double includes a function Double.parseDouble that\\ntries to convert a parameter of type String into a value of type double. F or example, the\\nvalue of the function call Double.parseDouble(\"3.14\") is the double value 3.14. (Of course,\\nin practice, the parameter used in Double.parseDouble or Integer.parseInt would be a\\nvariable or expression rather than a constant string.)\\nType conversion functions also exist for converting string s into enumerated type values.\\n(Enumerated types, or enums, were introduced in Subsection 2.3.3.) F or any enum type, a\\npredeﬁned function named valueOf is automatically deﬁned for that type. This is a function\\nthat takes a string as parameter and tries to convert it to a va lue belonging to the enum. The\\nvalueOf function is part of the enum type, so the name of the enum is par t of the full name of\\nthe function. F or example, if an enum Suit is deﬁned as\\nenum Suit { SPADE, DIAMOND, CLUB, HEART }\\nthen the name of the type conversion function would be Suit.valueOf. The value of the\\nfunction call Suit.valueOf(\"CLUB\") would be the enumerated type value Suit.CLUB. F or the\\nconversion to succeed, the string must exactly match the sim ple name of one of the enumerated\\ntype constants ( without the “Suit.” in front).\\n2.5.8 Precedence Rules\\nIf you use several operators in one expression, and if you don ’t use parentheses to explicitly\\nindicate the order of evaluation, then you have to worry abou t the precedence rules that deter-\\nmine the order of evaluation. (Advice: don’t confuse yourse lf or the reader of your program;\\nuse parentheses liberally .)\\nHere is a listing of the operators discussed in this section, listed in order from highest\\nprecedence (evaluated ﬁrst) to lowest precedence (evaluat ed last):\\nUnary operators: ++, --, !, unary - and +, type-cast\\nMultiplication and division: *, /, %\\nAddition and subtraction: +, -\\nRelational operators: <, >, <=, >=\\nEquality and inequality: ==, !=\\nBoolean and: &&\\nBoolean or: ||\\nConditional operator: ?:\\nAssignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %='),\n",

PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENTS 51\\nOperators on the same line have the same precedence. When ope rators of the same precedence\\nare strung together in the absence of parentheses, unary ope rators and assignment operators are\\nevaluated right-to-left, while the remaining operators ar e evaluated left-to-right. F or example,\\nA*B/C means (A*B)/C, while A=B=C means A=(B=C). (Can you see how the expression A=B=C\\nmight be useful, given that the value of B=C as an expression is the same as the value that is\\nassigned to B?)\\n2.6 Programming Environments\\nAlthough the Java languageis highly standardized, the procedures for creating, compi l-\\ning, and editing Java programs vary widely from one programm ing environment to another.\\nThere are two basic approaches: a command line environment , where the user types com-\\nmands and the computer responds, and an integrated development environment (IDE),\\nwhere the user uses the keyboard and mouse to interact with a g raphical user interface. While\\nthere is just one common command line environment for Java pr ogramming, there is a wide\\nvariety of IDEs.\\nI cannot give complete or deﬁnitive information on Java prog ramming environments in this\\nsection, but I will try to give enough information to let you c ompile and run the examples from\\nthis textbook, at least in a command line environment. There are many IDEs, and I can’t\\ncover them all here. I will concentrate on Eclipse, one of the most popular IDEs for Java\\nprogramming, but some of the information that is presented w ill apply to other IDEs as well.\\nOne thing to keep in mind is that you do not have to pay any money to do Java programming\\n(aside from buying a computer, of course). Everything that y ou need can be downloaded for\\nfree on the Internet.\\n2.6.1 Java Development Kit\\nThe basic development system for Java programming is usuall y referred to as the JDK (Java\\nDevelopment Kit). It is a part of J2SE, the Java 2 Platform Sta ndard Edition. This book\\nrequires J2SE version 5.0 (or higher). Confusingly , the JDK that is part of J2SE version 5.0\\nis sometimes referred to as JDK 1.5 instead of 5.0. Note that J 2SE comes in two versions,\\na Development Kit version and a Runtime version. The Runtime can be used to run Java\\nprograms and to view Java applets in W eb pages, but it does not allow you to compile your\\nown Java programs. The Development Kit includes the Runtime and adds to it the JDK which\\nlets you compile programs. Y ou need a JDK for use with this tex tbook.\\nJava was developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc., which makes it s JDK for Windows and Linux\\navailable for free download at its Java W eb site, java.sun.c om. If you have a Windows computer,\\nit might have come with a Java Runtime, but you might still nee d to download the JDK. Some\\nversions of Linux come with the JDK either installed by defau lt or on the installation media. If\\nyou need to download and install the JDK, be sure to get JDK 5.0 (or higher). As of June, 2006,\\nthe download page for JDK 5.0 can be found at http://java.sun .com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp.\\nMac OS comes with Java. The version included with Mac OS 10.4 i s 1.4.2, the version\\nprevious to Java 5.0. However, JDK V ersion 5.0 is available f or Mac OS 10.4 on Apple’s W eb\\nsite and can also be installed through the standard Mac OS Sof tware Update application.\\nIf a JDK is installed on your computer, you can use the command line environment to\\ncompile and run Java programs. Some IDEs depend on the JDK, so even if you plan to use an\\nIDE for programming, you might still need a JDK.'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\n2.6.2 Command Line Environment\\nMany modern computer users ﬁnd the command line environment to be pretty alien and unin-\\ntuitive. It is certainly very diﬀerent from the graphical us er interfaces that most people are used\\nto. However, it takes only a little practice to learn the basi cs of the command line environment\\nand to become productive using it.\\nT o use a command line programming environment, you will have to open a window where\\nyou can type in commands. In Windows, you can open such a comma nd window by running\\nthe program named cmd . One way to run cmd is to use the “Run Program” feature in the\\nStart menu, and enter “cmd” as the name of the program. In Mac O S, you want to run the\\nTerminal program, which can be be found in the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder.\\nIn Linux, there are several possibilities, including Konsole, gterm, and xterm.\\nNo matter what type of computer you are using, when you open a c ommand window, it\\nwill display a prompt of some sort. Type in a command at the pro mpt and press return. The\\ncomputer will carry out the command, displaying any output i n the command window, and will\\nthen redisplay the prompt so that you can type another comman d. One of the central concepts\\nin the command line environment is the current directory which contains the ﬁles to which\\ncommands that you type apply . (The words “directory” and “fo lder” mean the same thing.)\\nOften, the name of the current directory is part of the comman d prompt. Y ou can get a list of\\nthe ﬁles in the current directory by typing in the command dir (on Windows) or ls (on Linux\\nand Mac OS). When the window ﬁrst opens, the current director y is your home directory ,\\nwhere all your ﬁles are stored. Y ou can change the current dir ectory using the cd command\\nwith the name of the directory that you want to use. F or exampl e, to change into your Desktop\\ndirectory , type in the command cd Desktop and press return.\\nY ou should create a directory (that is, a folder) to hold your Java work. F or example, create a\\ndirectory named javawork in your home directory . Y ou can do this using your computer’s GUI;\\nanother way to do it is to open a command window and enter the co mmand mkdir javawork.\\nWhen you want to work on programming, open a command window an d enter the command\\ncd javawork to change into your work directory . Of course, you can have mo re than one\\nworking directory for your Java work; you can organize your ﬁ les any way you like.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe most basic commands for using Java on the command line are javac and java; javac\\nis used to compile Java source code, and java is used to run Java stand-alone applications. If a\\nJDK is correctly installed on your computer, it should recog nize these commands when you type\\nthem in on the command line. T ry typing the commands java -version and javac -version\\nwhich should tell you which version of Java is installed. If y ou get a message such as “Command\\nnot found,” then Java is not correctly installed. If the “jav a” command works, but “javac” does\\nnot, it means that a Java Runtime is installed rather than a De velopment Kit.\\nT o test the javac command, place a copy of TextIO.java into your working directory . (If you\\ndownloaded the W eb site of this book, you can ﬁnd it in the dire ctory named source; you can\\nuse your computer’s GUI to copy-and-paste this ﬁle into your working directory . Alternatively ,\\nyou can navigate to TextIO.java on the book’s W eb site and use the “Save As” command in\\nyour W eb browser to save a copy of the ﬁle into your working dir ectory .) Type the command:\\njavac TextIO.java\\nThis will compile TextIO.java and will create a bytecode ﬁle named TextIO.class in the same\\ndirectory . Note that if the command succeeds, you will not ge t any response from the computer;\\nit will just redisplay the command prompt to tell you it’s rea dy for another command.'),\n",

PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENTS 53\\nT o test the java command, copy sample program Interest2.java from this book’s source\\ndirectory into your working directory . First, compile the p rogram with the command\\njavac Interest2.java\\nRemember that for this to succeed, T extIO must already be in the same directory . Then you\\ncan execute the program using the command\\njava Interest2\\nBe careful to use just the name of the program, Interest2, not the name of the Java source\\ncode ﬁle or the name of the compiled class ﬁle. When you give th is command, the program will\\nrun. Y ou will be asked to enter some information, and you will respond by typing your answers\\ninto the command window, pressing return at the end of the lin e. When the program ends, you\\nwill see the command prompt, and you can enter another comman d.\\nY ou can follow the same procedure to run all of the examples in the early sections of this\\nbook. When you start work with applets, you will need a diﬀere nt command to execute the\\napplets. That command will be introduced later in the book.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nT o create your own programs, you will need a text editor . A text editor is a computer\\nprogram that allows you to create and save documents that con tain plain text. It is important\\nthat the documents be saved as plain text, that is without any special encoding or formatting\\ninformation. W ord processor documents are not appropriate , unless you can get your word\\nprocessor to save as plain text. A good text editor can make pr ogramming a lot more pleasant.\\nLinux comes with several text editors. On Windows, you can us e notepad in a pinch, but you\\nwill probably want something better. F or Mac OS, you might do wnload the free TextWrangler\\napplication. One possibility that will work on any platform is to use jedit, a good programmer’s\\ntext editor that is itself written in Java and that can be down loaded for free from www.jedit.org.\\nT o create your own programs, you should open a command line wi ndow and cd into the\\nworking directory where you will store your source code ﬁles . Start up your text editor program,\\nsuch as by double-clicking its icon or selecting it from a Sta rt menu. Type your code into the\\neditor window, or open an existing source code ﬁle that you wa nt to modify . Save the ﬁle.\\nRemember that the name of a Java source code ﬁle must end in “.j ava”, and the rest of the\\nﬁle name must match the name of the class that is deﬁned in the ﬁ le. Once the ﬁle is saved in\\nyour working directory , go to the command window and use the javac command to compile it,\\nas discussed above. If there are syntax errors in the code, th ey will be listed in the command\\nwindow. Each error message contains the line number in the ﬁl e where the computer found the\\nerror. Go back to the editor and try to ﬁx the errors, save your changes , and they try the\\njavac command again. (It’s usually a good idea to just work on the ﬁr st few errors; sometimes\\nﬁxing those will make other errors go away .) Remember that wh en the javac command ﬁnally\\nsucceeds, you will get no message at all. Then you can use the java command to run your\\nprogram, as described above. Once you’ve compiled the progr am, you can run it as many times\\nas you like without recompiling it.\\nThat’s really all there is to it: Keep both editor and command -line window open. Edit,\\nsave, and compile until you have eliminated all the syntax er rors. (Always remember to save\\nthe ﬁle before compiling it—the compiler only sees the saved ﬁle, not the version in the editor\\nwindow.) When you run the program, you might ﬁnd that it has se mantic errors that cause it\\nto run incorrectly . It that case, you have to go back to the edi t/save/compile loop to try to\\nﬁnd and ﬁx the problem.'),\n",

NAMES AND THINGS\\n2.6.3 IDEs and Eclipse\\nIn an Integrated Development Environment, everything you n eed to create, compile, and run\\nprograms is integrated into a single package, with a graphic al user interface that will be familiar\\nto most computer users. There are many diﬀerent IDEs for Java program development, ranging\\nfrom fairly simple wrappers around the JDK to highly complex applications with a multitude\\nof features. F or a beginning programmer, there is a danger in using an IDE, since the diﬃculty\\nof learning to use the IDE, on top of the diﬃculty of learning t o program, can be overwhelming.\\nRecently , however, I have begun using one IDE, Eclipse, in my introductory programming\\ncourses. Eclipse has a variety of features that are very usef ul for a beginning programmer.\\nAnd even though it has many advanced features, its design mak es it possible to use Eclipse\\nwithout understanding its full complexity . It is likely tha t other modern IDEs have similar\\nproperties, but my only in-depth experience is with Eclipse . Eclipse is used by many professional\\nprogrammers and is probably the most commonly used Java IDE. (In fact, Eclipse is actually\\na general development platform that can be used for other pur poses besides Java development,\\nbut its most common use is Java.)\\nEclipse is itself written in Java. It requires Java 1.4 (or hi gher) to run, so it works on any\\ncomputer platform that supports Java 1.4, including Linux, Windows, and recent versions of\\nMac OS. If you want to use Eclipse to compile and run Java 5.0 pr ograms, you need Eclipse\\nversion 3.1 (or higher). F urthermore, Eclipse requires a JD K. Y ou should make sure that\\nJDK 5.0 (or higher) is installed on your computer, as describ ed above, before you install\\nEclipse. Eclipse can be downloaded for free from www.eclips e.org.\\nThe ﬁrst time you start Eclipse, you will be asked to specify a workspace, which is the\\ndirectory where all your work will be stored. Y ou can accept t he default name, or provide one\\nof your own. When startup is complete, the Eclipse window wil l be ﬁlled by a large “W elcome”\\nscreen that includes links to extensive documentation and t utorials. Y ou can close this screen,\\nby clicking the “X” next to the word “W elcome”; you can get bac k to it later by choosing\\n“W elcome” from the “Help” menu.\\nThe Eclipse GUI consists of one large window that is divided i nto several sections. Each\\nsection contains one or more views. If there are several views in one section, there there will\\nbe tabs at the top of the section to select the view that is disp layed in that section. Each view\\ndisplays a diﬀerent type of information. The whole set of vie ws is called a perspective. Eclipse\\nuses diﬀerent perspectives, that is diﬀerent sets of views o f diﬀerent types of information, for\\ndiﬀerent tasks.

Click on the small triangle\\nnext to the project name to see the contents of the project. At the beginning, it contains only\\nthe “JRE System Library”; this is the collection of standard built-in classes that come with\\nJava.\\nT o run the T extIO based examples from this textbook, you must add the source co de ﬁle\\nTextIO.java to your project.

Alternatively , you can navigate to the ﬁle on-line\\nand use the “Save As” command of your W eb browser to save a copy of the ﬁle onto your\\ncomputer. The easiest way to get T extIO into your project is to locate the source code ﬁle on\\nyour computer and drag the ﬁle icon onto the project name in th e Eclipse window. If that\\ndoesn’t work, you can try using copy-and-paste: Right-clic k the ﬁle icon (or control-click on\\nMac OS), select “Copy” from the pop-up menu, right-click the project name in the Eclipse\\nwindow, and select “Paste”. If you also have trouble with tha t, you can try using the “Import”\\ncommand in the “File” menu; select “File system” in the windo w that pops up, click “Next”,\\nand provide the necessary information in the next window. (U nfortunately , using the ﬁle import\\nwindow is rather complicated. If you ﬁnd that you have to use i t, you should consult the Eclipse\\ndocumentation about it.) In any case, T extIO should appear in your project, inside a package\\nnamed “default package”. Y ou will need to click the small tri angle next to “default package”\\nto see the ﬁle. Once a ﬁle is in this list, you can open it by doub le-clicking it; it will appear in\\nthe editing area of the Eclipse window.\\nT o run any of the Java programs from this textbook, copy the so urce code ﬁle into your\\nEclipse Java project.

If a n error marker displays a\\nsmall “light bulb,” Eclipse is oﬀering to try to ﬁx the error f or you. Click the light bulb to get\\na list of possible ﬁxes, then double click the ﬁx that you want to apply . F or example, if you\\nuse an undeclared variable in your program, Eclipse will oﬀe r to declare it for you. Y ou can\\nactually use this error-correcting feature to get Eclipse t o write certain types of code for you!\\nUnfortunately , you’ll ﬁnd that you won’t understand a lot of the proposed ﬁxes until you learn\\nmore about the Java language.\\nAnother nice Eclipse feature is code assist . Code assist can be invoked by typing Control-\\nSpace. It will oﬀer possible completions of whatever you are typing at the moment. F or example,\\nif you type part of an identiﬁer and hit Control-Space, you wi ll get a list of identiﬁers that start\\nwith the characters that you have typed; use the up and down ar row keys to select one of the\\nitems in the list, and press Return or Enter. (Or hit Escape to dismiss the list.) If there is\\nonly one possible completion when you hit Control-Space, it will be inserted automatically . By\\ndefault, Code Assist will also pop up automatically , after a short delay , when you type a period\\nor certain other characters. F or example, if you type “ TextIO.” and pause for just a fraction\\nof a second, you will get a list of all the subroutines in the T extIO class. Personally , I ﬁnd this\\nauto-activation annoying. Y ou can disable it in the Eclipse Preferences. (Look under Java /\\nEditor / Code Assist, and turn oﬀ the “Enable auto activation ” option.) Y ou can still call up\\nCode Assist manually with Control-Space.\\nOnce you have an error-free program, you can run it as describ ed above, by right-clicking its\\nname in the Package Explorer and using “Run As / Java Applicat ion”. If you ﬁnd a problem\\nwhen you run it, it’s very easy to go back to the editor, make ch anges, and run it again. Note\\nthat using Eclipse, there is no explicit “compile” command. The source code ﬁles in your\\nproject are automatically compiled, and are re-compiled wh enever you modify them.\\nAlthough I have only talked about Eclipse here, if you are usi ng a diﬀerent IDE, you will\\nprobably ﬁnd a lot of similarities. Most IDEs use the concept of a “project” to which you have\\nto add your source code ﬁles, and most of them have menu comman ds for running a program.\\nAll of them, of course, come with built-in text editors.\\n2.6.4 The Problem of Packages\\nEvery class in Java is contained in something called a package. Classes that are not explicitly\\nput into a diﬀerent package are in the “default” package. Alm ost all the examples in this\\ntextbook are in the default package, and I will not even discu ss packages in any depth until\\nSection 4.5. However, some IDEs might force you to pay attent ion to packages.\\nWhen you create a class in Eclipse, you might notice a message that says that “The use\\nof the default package is discouraged.” Although this is tru e, I have chosen to use it anyway ,\\nsince it seems easier for beginning programmers to avoid the whole issue of packages, at least\\nat ﬁrst. Some IDEs might be even less willing than Eclipse to u se the default package. If you\\ncreate a class in a package, the source code starts with a line that speciﬁes which package the\\nclass is in. F or example, if the class is in a package named testpkg, then the ﬁrst line of the\\nsource code will be\\npackage testpkg;\\nIn an IDE, this will not cause any problem unless the program y ou are writing depends on\\nT extIO. Y ou will not be able to use T extIO in a program unless T extIO is placed into the same\\npackage as the program. This means that you have to modify the source code ﬁle TextIO.java'),\n",

Starting with this chapter,\\nwe look at how these building blocks can be put together to bui ld complex programs with more\\ninteresting behavior.\\nSince we are still working on the level of “programming in the small” in this chapter, we are\\ninterested in the kind of complexity that can occur within a s ingle subroutine. On this level,\\ncomplexity is provided by control structures . The two types of control structures, loops and\\nbranches, can be used to repeat a sequence of statements over and over or to choose among two\\nor more possible courses of action. Java includes several co ntrol structures of each type, and\\nwe will look at each of them in some detail.\\nThis chapter will also begin the study of program design. Giv en a problem, how can you\\ncome up with a program to solve that problem? W e’ll look at a pa rtial answer to this question\\nin Section 3.2.\\n3.1 Blocks, Loops, and Branches\\nThe ability of a computer to perform complex tasks is built on just a few ways of\\ncombining simple commands into control structures. In Java , there are just six such structures\\nthat are used to determine the normal ﬂow of control in a progr am—and, in fact, just three\\nof them would be enough to write programs to perform any task. The six control structures\\nare: the block, the while loop , the do..while loop , the for loop , the if statement , and the\\nswitch statement . Each of these structures is considered to be a single “state ment,” but each\\nis in fact a structured statement that can contain one or more other statements insi de itself.\\n3.1.1 Blocks\\nThe block is the simplest type of structured statement. Its purpose is simply to group a\\nsequence of statements into a single statement. The format o f a block is:\\n{\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\n61'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'AFPL Ghostscript 8.51', 'creator': 'dvips(k) 5.95b Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software', 'creationdate': 'D:20071115202101', 'moddate': 'D:20071115202101', 'title': 'javanotes.dvi', 'source': '../data/rag_data/javanotes5.pdf', 'total_pages': 699, 'page': 77, 'page_label': '78', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='62 CHAPTER 3. CONTROL\\nThat is, it consists of a sequence of statements enclosed bet ween a pair of braces, “ {” and “ }”.\\n(In fact, it is possible for a block to contain no statements a t all; such a block is called an\\nempty block , and can actually be useful at times. An empty block consists of nothing but\\nan empty pair of braces.) Block statements usually occur ins ide other statements, where their\\npurpose is to group together several statements into a unit. However, a block can be legally\\nused wherever a statement can occur. There is one place where a block is required: As you\\nmight have already noticed in the case of the main subroutine of a program, the deﬁnition of a\\nsubroutine is a block, since it is a sequence of statements en closed inside a pair of braces.\\nI should probably note again at this point that Java is what is called a free-format language.\\nThere are no syntax rules about how the language has to be arra nged on a page. So, for example,\\nyou could write an entire block on one line if you want. But as a matter of good programming\\nstyle, you should lay out your program on the page in a way that will make its structure as\\nclear as possible. In general, this means putting one statem ent per line and using indentation\\nto indicate statements that are contained inside control st ructures. This is the format that I\\nwill generally use in my examples.\\nHere are two examples of blocks:\\n{\\nSystem.out.print(\"The answer is \");\\nSystem.out.println(ans);\\n}\\n{ // This block exchanges the values of x and y\\nint temp; // A temporary variable for use in this block.\\ntemp = x; // Save a copy of the value of x in temp.\\nx = y; // Copy the value of y into x.\\ny = temp; // Copy the value of temp into y.\\n}\\nIn the second example, a variable, temp, is declared inside the block. This is perfectly legal,\\nand it is good style to declare a variable inside a block if tha t variable is used nowhere else\\nbut inside the block. A variable declared inside a block is co mpletely inaccessible and invisible\\nfrom outside that block. When the computer executes the vari able declaration statement, it\\nallocates memory to hold the value of the variable. When the b lock ends, that memory is\\ndiscarded (that is, made available for reuse). The variable is said to be local to the block.\\nThere is a general concept called the “scope” of an identiﬁer . The scope of an identiﬁer is the\\npart of the program in which that identiﬁer is valid. The scop e of a variable deﬁned inside a\\nblock is limited to that block, and more speciﬁcally to the pa rt of the block that comes after\\nthe declaration of the variable.\\n3.1.2 The Basic While Loop\\nThe block statement by itself really doesn’t aﬀect the ﬂow of control in a program. The ﬁve\\nremaining control structures do. They can be divided into tw o classes: loop statements and\\nbranching statements. Y ou really just need one control stru cture from each category in order to\\nhave a completely general-purpose programming language. M ore than that is just convenience.\\nIn this section, I’ll introduce the while loop and the if statement. I’ll give the full details of\\nthese statements and of the other three control structures i n later sections.\\nA while loop is used to repeat a given statement over and over. Of course, i t’s not likely\\nthat you would want to keep repeating it forever. That would b e an inﬁnite loop , which is'),\n",

BLOCKS, LOOPS, AND BRANCHES 63\\ngenerally a bad thing. (There is an old story about computer p ioneer Grace Murray Hopper,\\nwho read instructions on a bottle of shampoo telling her to “l ather, rinse, repeat.” As the story\\ngoes, she claims that she tried to follow the directions, but she ran out of shampoo. (In case\\nyou don’t get it, this is a joke about the way that computers mi ndlessly follow instructions.))\\nT o be more speciﬁc, a while loop will repeat a statement over and over, but only so long\\nas a speciﬁed condition remains true. A while loop has the form:\\nwhile (⟨boolean-expression ⟩)\\n⟨statement ⟩\\nSince the statement can be, and usually is, a block, many while loops have the form:\\nwhile (⟨boolean-expression ⟩) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nThe semantics of this statement go like this: When the comput er comes to a while state-\\nment, it evaluates the ⟨boolean-expression⟩, which yields either true or false as the value. If\\nthe value is false, the computer skips over the rest of the while loop and proceeds to the next\\ncommand in the program. If the value of the expression is true, the computer executes the\\n⟨statement⟩ or block of ⟨statements⟩ inside the loop. Then it returns to the beginning of the\\nwhile loop and repeats the process. That is, it re-evaluates the ⟨boolean-expression⟩, ends the\\nloop if the value is false, and continues it if the value is true. This will continue over and over\\nuntil the value of the expression is false; if that never happens, then there will be an inﬁnite\\nloop.\\nHere is an example of a while loop that simply prints out the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:\\nint number; // The number to be printed.\\nnumber = 1; // Start with 1.\\nwhile ( number < 6 ) { // Keep going as long as number is < 6.\\nSystem.out.println(number);\\nnumber = number + 1; // Go on to the next number.\\n}\\nSystem.out.println(\"Done!\");\\nThe variable number is initialized with the value 1. So the ﬁrst time through the while loop,\\nwhen the computer evaluates the expression “ number < 6”, it is asking whether 1 is less than 6,\\nwhich is true. The computer therefor proceeds to execute the two statemen ts inside the loop.\\nThe ﬁrst statement prints out “1”. The second statement adds 1 to number and stores the\\nresult back into the variable number; the value of number has been changed to 2. The computer\\nhas reached the end of the loop, so it returns to the beginning and asks again whether number is\\nless than 6. Once again this is true, so the computer executes the loop again, this time printing\\nout 2 as the value of number and then changing the value of number to 3. It continues in this\\nway until eventually number becomes equal to 6. At that point, the expression “ number < 6”\\nevaluates to false. So, the computer jumps past the end of the loop to the next sta tement\\nand prints out the message “Done!”. Note that when the loop en ds, the value of number is 6,\\nbut the last value that was printed was 5.\\nBy the way , you should remember that you’ll never see a while loop standing by itself\\nin a real program. It will always be inside a subroutine which is itself deﬁned inside some\\nclass. As an example of a while loop used inside a complete program, here is a little program\\nthat computes the interest on an investment over several yea rs.

If the valu e\\nis true, the computer executes the ﬁrst statement and skips the stat ement that follows the\\n“ else”. If the value of the expression is false, then the computer skips the ﬁrst statement and\\nexecutes the second one. Note that in any case, one and only on e of the two statements inside\\nthe if statement is executed. The two statements represent altern ative courses of action; the\\ncomputer decides between these courses of action based on th e value of the boolean expression.\\nIn many cases, you want the computer to choose between doing s omething and not doing\\nit. Y ou can do this with an if statement that omits the else part:\\nif ( ⟨boolean-expression ⟩ )\\n⟨statement ⟩\\nT o execute this statement, the computer evaluates the expre ssion. If the value is true, the\\ncomputer executes the ⟨statement⟩ that is contained inside the if statement; if the value is\\nfalse, the computer skips that ⟨statement⟩.\\nOf course, either or both of the ⟨statement⟩’s in an if statement can be a block, so that an\\nif statement often looks like:\\nif ( ⟨boolean-expression ⟩ ) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nelse {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nor:\\nif ( ⟨boolean-expression ⟩ ) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nAs an example, here is an if statement that exchanges the value of two variables, x and y,\\nbut only if x is greater than y to begin with. After this if statement has been executed, we\\ncan be sure that the value of x is deﬁnitely less than or equal to the value of y:\\nif ( x > y ) {\\nint temp; // A temporary variable for use in this block.\\ntemp = x; // Save a copy of the value of x in temp.\\nx = y; // Copy the value of y into x.\\ny = temp; // Copy the value of temp into y.\\n}\\nFinally , here is an example of an if statement that includes an else part.

But you already know\\nthe essentials. If you never learned anything more about con trol structures, you would already\\nknow enough to perform any possible computing task. Simple l ooping and branching are all\\nyou really need!\\n3.2 Algorithm Development\\nProgramming is difficult (like many activities that are useful and worthwhile—and li ke\\nmost of those activities, it can also be rewarding and a lot of fun). When you write a program,\\nyou have to tell the computer every small detail of what to do. And you have to get everything\\nexactly right, since the computer will blindly follow your p rogram exactly as written. How,\\nthen, do people write any but the most simple programs? It’s n ot a big mystery , actually . It’s\\na matter of learning to think in the right way .\\nA program is an expression of an idea. A programmer starts wit h a general idea of a task\\nfor the computer to perform. Presumably , the programmer has some idea of how to perform\\nthe task by hand, at least in general outline. The problem is t o ﬂesh out that outline into a\\ncomplete, unambiguous, step-by-step procedure for carryi ng out the task. Such a procedure is\\ncalled an “algorithm.” (T echnically , an algorithm is an unambiguous, step-by-step procedure\\nthat terminates after a ﬁnite number of steps; we don’t want t o count procedures that go on\\nforever.) An algorithm is not the same as a program. A program is written in some particular\\nprogramming language. An algorithm is more like the idea behind the program, but it’s the\\nidea of the steps the program will take to perform its task, not just the idea of the task itself.\\nThe steps of the algorithm don’t have to be ﬁlled in in complet e detail, as long as the steps are\\nunambiguous and it’s clear that carrying out the steps will a ccomplish the assigned task. An\\nalgorithm can be expressed in any language, including Engli sh. Of course, an algorithm can\\nonly be expressed as a program if all the details have been ﬁll ed in.\\nSo, where do algorithms come from? Usually , they have to be de veloped, often with a lot of\\nthought and hard work. Skill at algorithm development is som ething that comes with practice,\\nbut there are techniques and guidelines that can help. I’ll t alk here about some techniques and\\nguidelines that are relevant to “programming in the small,” and I will return to the subject\\nseveral times in later chapters.\\n3.2.1 Pseudocode and Stepwise Reﬁnement\\nWhen programming in the small, you have a few basics to work wi th: variables, assignment\\nstatements, and input/output routines. Y ou might also have some subroutines, objects, or\\nother building blocks that have already been written by you o r someone else. (Input/output\\nroutines fall into this class.) Y ou can build sequences of th ese basic instructions, and you can\\nalso combine them into more complex control structures such as while loops and if statements.\\nSuppose you have a task in mind that you want the computer to pe rform. One way to\\nproceed is to write a description of the task, and take that de scription as an outline of the\\nalgorithm you want to develop. Then you can reﬁne and elabora te that description, gradually\\nadding steps and detail, until you have a complete algorithm that can be translated directly\\ninto programming language. This method is called stepwise reﬁnement , and it is a type of'),\n",

ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT 67\\ntop-down design. As you proceed through the stages of stepwi se reﬁnement, you can write out\\ndescriptions of your algorithm in pseudocode—informal instructions that imitate the structure\\nof programming languages without the complete detail and pe rfect syntax of actual program\\ncode.\\nAs an example, let’s see how one might develop the program fro m the previous section, which\\ncomputes the value of an investment over ﬁve years. The task t hat you want the program to\\nperform is: “Compute and display the value of an investment f or each of the next ﬁve years,\\nwhere the initial investment and interest rate are to be spec iﬁed by the user.” Y ou might then\\nwrite—or at least think—that this can be expanded as:\\nGet the user’s input\\nCompute the value of the investment after 1 year\\nDisplay the value\\nCompute the value after 2 years\\nDisplay the value\\nCompute the value after 3 years\\nDisplay the value\\nCompute the value after 4 years\\nDisplay the value\\nCompute the value after 5 years\\nDisplay the value\\nThis is correct, but rather repetitive. And seeing that repe tition, you might notice an\\nopportunity to use a loop. A loop would take less typing. More important, it would be more\\ngeneral: Essentially the same loop will work no matter how many years you want to process.\\nSo, you might rewrite the above sequence of steps as:\\nGet the user’s input\\nwhile there are more years to process:\\nCompute the value after the next year\\nDisplay the value\\nF ollowing this algorithm would certainly solve the problem , but for a computer, we’ll have\\nto be more explicit about how to “Get the user’s input,” how to “Compute the value after the\\nnext year,” and what it means to say “there are more years to pr ocess.” W e can expand the\\nstep, “Get the user’s input” into\\nAsk the user for the initial investment\\nRead the user’s response\\nAsk the user for the interest rate\\nRead the user’s response\\nT o ﬁll in the details of the step “Compute the value after the n ext year,” you have to\\nknow how to do the computation yourself. (Maybe you need to as k your boss or professor for\\nclariﬁcation?) Let’s say you know that the value is computed by adding some interest to the\\nprevious value. Then we can reﬁne the while loop to:\\nwhile there are more years to process:\\nCompute the interest\\nAdd the interest to the value\\nDisplay the value\\nAs for testing whether there are more years to process, the on ly way that we can do that is\\nby counting the years ourselves. This displays a very common pattern, and you should expect\\nto use something similar in a lot of programs: W e have to start with zero years, add one each'),\n",

So the while\\nloop becomes:\\nyears = 0\\nwhile years < 5:\\nyears = years + 1\\nCompute the interest\\nAdd the interest to the value\\nDisplay the value\\nW e still have to know how to compute the interest. Let’s say th at the interest is to be\\ncomputed by multiplying the interest rate by the current val ue of the investment. Putting\\nthis together with the part of the algorithm that gets the use r’s inputs, we have the complete\\nalgorithm:\\nAsk the user for the initial investment\\nRead the user’s response\\nAsk the user for the interest rate\\nRead the user’s response\\nyears = 0\\nwhile years < 5:\\nyears = years + 1\\nCompute interest = value * interest rate\\nAdd the interest to the value\\nDisplay the value\\nFinally , we are at the point where we can translate pretty dir ectly into proper programming-\\nlanguage syntax. W e still have to choose names for the variab les, decide exactly what we want\\nto say to the user, and so forth. Having done this, we could exp ress our algorithm in Java as:\\ndouble principal, rate, interest; // declare the variables\\nint years;\\nSystem.out.print(\"Type initial investment: \");\\nprincipal = TextIO.getlnDouble();\\nSystem.out.print(\"Type interest rate: \");\\nrate = TextIO.getlnDouble();\\nyears = 0;\\nwhile (years < 5) {\\nyears = years + 1;\\ninterest = principal * rate;\\nprincipal = principal + interest;\\nSystem.out.println(principal);\\n}\\nThis still needs to be wrapped inside a complete program, it s till needs to be commented,\\nand it really needs to print out more information in a nicer fo rmat for the user. But it’s\\nessentially the same program as the one in the previous secti on. (Note that the pseudocode\\nalgorithm uses indentation to show which statements are ins ide the loop. In Java, indentation\\nis completely ignored by the computer, so you need a pair of br aces to tell the computer which\\nstatements are in the loop. If you leave out the braces, the on ly statement inside the loop would\\nbe “ years = years + 1;\". The other statements would only be executed once, after the loop\\nends.

The c omputer can recognize\\nsyntax errors but not semantic errors.)\\nOne thing you should have noticed here is that my original spe ciﬁcation of the problem—\\n“Compute and display the value of an investment for each of th e next ﬁve years”—was far from\\nbeing complete. Before you start writing a program, you shou ld make sure you have a complete\\nspeciﬁcation of exactly what the program is supposed to do. I n particular, you need to know\\nwhat information the program is going to input and output and what computation it is going\\nto perform. Here is what a reasonably complete speciﬁcation of the problem might look like in\\nthis example:\\n“W rite a program that will compute and display the value of\\nan investment for each of the next ﬁve years. Each year, inter est\\nis added to the value. The interest is computed by multiplyin g\\nthe current value by a ﬁxed interest rate. Assume that the ini tial\\nvalue and the rate of interest are to be input by the user when t he\\nprogram is run.”\\n3.2.2 The 3N+1 Problem\\nLet’s do another example, working this time with a program th at you haven’t already seen. The\\nassignment here is an abstract mathematical problem that is one of my favorite programming\\nexercises. This time, we’ll start with a more complete speci ﬁcation of the task to be performed:\\n“Given a positive integer, N, deﬁne the ’3N+1’ sequence star t-\\ning from N as follows: If N is an even number, then divide N by\\ntwo; but if N is odd, then multiply N by 3 and add 1. Continue\\nto generate numbers in this way until N becomes equal to 1. F or\\nexample, starting from N = 3, which is odd, we multiply by 3 and\\nadd 1, giving N = 3*3+1 = 10. Then, since N is even, we divide\\nby 2, giving N = 10/2 = 5. W e continue in this way , stopping\\nwhen we reach 1, giving the complete sequence: 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4,\\n2, 1.\\n“W rite a program that will read a positive integer from the\\nuser and will print out the 3N+1 sequence starting from that\\ninteger. The program should also count and print out the numb er\\nof terms in the sequence.”\\nA general outline of the algorithm for the program we want is:\\nGet a positive integer N from the user;\\nCompute, print, and count each number in the sequence;\\nOutput the number of terms;\\nThe bulk of the program is in the second step. W e’ll need a loop , since we want to keep\\ncomputing numbers until we get 1. T o put this in terms appropr iate for a while loop, we want\\nto continue as long as the number is not 1. So, we can expand our pseudocode algorithm to:\\nGet a positive integer N from the user;\\nwhile N is not 1:\\nCompute N = next term;\\nOutput N;\\nCount this term;\\nOutput the number of terms;'),\n",

CONTROL\\nIn order to compute the next term, the computer must take diﬀe rent actions depending on\\nwhether N is even or odd. W e need an if statement to decide between the two cases:\\nGet a positive integer N from the user;\\nwhile N is not 1:\\nif N is even:\\nCompute N = N/2;\\nelse\\nCompute N = 3 * N + 1;\\nOutput N;\\nCount this term;\\nOutput the number of terms;\\nW e are almost there. The one problem that remains is counting . Counting means that you\\nstart with zero, and every time you have something to count, y ou add one. W e need a variable\\nto do the counting. (Again, this is a common pattern that you s hould expect to see over and\\nover.) With the counter added, we get:\\nGet a positive integer N from the user;\\nLet counter = 0;\\nwhile N is not 1:\\nif N is even:\\nCompute N = N/2;\\nelse\\nCompute N = 3 * N + 1;\\nOutput N;\\nAdd 1 to counter;\\nOutput the counter;\\nW e still have to worry about the very ﬁrst step. How can we get a positive integer from the\\nuser? If we just read in a number, it’s possible that the user m ight type in a negative number\\nor zero. If you follow what happens when the value of N is negat ive or zero, you’ll see that the\\nprogram will go on forever, since the value of N will never bec ome equal to 1. This is bad. In\\nthis case, the problem is probably no big deal, but in general you should try to write programs\\nthat are foolproof. One way to ﬁx this is to keep reading in num bers until the user types in a\\npositive number:\\nAsk user to input a positive number;\\nLet N be the user’s response;\\nwhile N is not positive:\\nPrint an error message;\\nRead another value for N;\\nLet counter = 0;\\nwhile N is not 1:\\nif N is even:\\nCompute N = N/2;\\nelse\\nCompute N = 3 * N + 1;\\nOutput N;\\nAdd 1 to counter;\\nOutput the counter;\\nThe ﬁrst while loop will end only when N is a positive number, as required. (A common\\nbeginning programmer’s error is to use an if statement instead of a while statement here:\\n“If N is not positive, ask the user to input another value.” Th e problem arises if the second'),\n",

Although individual sequences are\\neasy to compute, no one has been able to answer the general que stion. T o put this another\\nway , no one knows whether the process of computing 3N+1 seque nces can properly be called\\nan algorithm, since an algorithm is required to terminate af ter a ﬁnite number of steps! (This\\ndiscussion assumes that the value of N can take on arbitrarily large integer values, which is not\\ntrue for a variable of type int in a Java program.)\\n3.2.3 Coding, T esting, Debugging\\nIt would be nice if, having developed an algorithm for your pr ogram, you could relax, press a\\nbutton, and get a perfectly working program. Unfortunately , the process of turning an algorithm\\ninto Java source code doesn’t always go smoothly . And when yo u do get to the stage of a working\\nprogram, it’s often only working in the sense that it does something. Unfortunately not what\\nyou want it to do.\\nAfter program design comes coding: translating the design i nto a program written in Java\\nor some other language. Usually , no matter how careful you ar e, a few syntax errors will creep\\nin from somewhere, and the Java compiler will reject your pro gram with some kind of error\\nmessage. Unfortunately , while a compiler will always detec t syntax errors, it’s not very good\\nabout telling you exactly what’s wrong. Sometimes, it’s not even good about telling you where\\nthe real error is. A spelling error or missing “ {” on line 45 might cause the compiler to choke\\non line 105. Y ou can avoid lots of errors by making sure that yo u really understand the syntax\\nrules of the language and by following some basic programmin g guidelines. F or example, I\\nnever type a “ {” without typing the matching “ }”. Then I go back and ﬁll in the statements\\nbetween the braces. A missing or extra brace can be one of the h ardest errors to ﬁnd in a large\\nprogram. Always, always indent your program nicely . If you c hange the program, change the\\nindentation to match. It’s worth the trouble. Use a consiste nt naming scheme, so you don’t\\nhave to struggle to remember whether you called that variabl e interestrate or interestRate.\\nIn general, when the compiler gives multiple error messages , don’t try to ﬁx the second error\\nmessage from the compiler until you’ve ﬁxed the ﬁrst one. Onc e the compiler hits an error in\\nyour program, it can get confused, and the rest of the error me ssages might just be guesses.\\nMaybe the best advice is: T ake the time to understand the erro r before you try to ﬁx it.\\nProgramming is not an experimental science.\\nWhen your program compiles without error, you are still not d one. Y ou have to test the\\nprogram to make sure it works correctly . Remember that the go al is not to get the right output\\nfor the two sample inputs that the professor gave in class. Th e goal is a program that will\\nwork correctly for all reasonable inputs. Ideally , when fac ed with an unreasonable input, it\\nwill respond by gently chiding the user rather than by crashi ng. T est your program on a wide\\nvariety of inputs. T ry to ﬁnd a set of inputs that will test the full range of functionality that\\nyou’ve coded into your program. As you begin writing larger p rograms, write them in stages\\nand test each stage along the way . Y ou might even have to write some extra code to do the\\ntesting—for example to call a subroutine that you’ve just wr itten. Y ou don’t want to be faced,\\nif you can avoid it, with 500 newly written lines of code that h ave an error in there somewhere.'),\n",

And the sad fact is that yo u will probably ﬁnd them. Again,\\nyou can minimize bugs by careful design and careful coding, b ut no one has found a way to\\navoid them altogether.

This is hard. I can still\\nremember the time I spent hours looking for a bug only to ﬁnd th at a line of code that I had\\nlooked at ten times had a “1” where it should have had an “i”, or the time when I wrote a\\nsubroutine named WindowClosing which would have done exactly what I wanted except that\\nthe computer was looking for windowClosing (with a lower case “w”). Sometimes it can help\\nto have someone who doesn’t share your preconceptions look a t your code.\\nOften, it’s a problem just to ﬁnd the part of the program that c ontains the error. Most\\nprogramming environments come with a debugger, which is a program that can help you ﬁnd\\nbugs. Typically , your program can be run under the control of the debugger. The debugger\\nallows you to set “breakpoints” in your program. A breakpoin t is a point in the program where\\nthe debugger will pause the program so you can look at the valu es of the program’s variables.\\nThe idea is to track down exactly when things start to go wrong during the program’s execution.\\nThe debugger will also let you execute your program one line a t a time, so that you can watch\\nwhat happens in detail once you know the general area in the pr ogram where the bug is lurking.\\nI will confess that I only rarely use debuggers myself. A more traditional approach to\\ndebugging is to insert debugging statements into your program. These are output statements\\nthat print out information about the state of the program. Ty pically , a debugging statement\\nwould say something like\\nSystem.out.println(\"At start of while loop, N = \"+ N);\\nY ou need to be able to tell from the output where in your progra m the output is coming from,\\nand you want to know the value of important variables. Someti mes, you will ﬁnd that the\\ncomputer isn’t even getting to a part of the program that you t hink it should be executing.\\nRemember that the goal is to ﬁnd the ﬁrst point in the program w here the state is not what\\nyou expect it to be. That’s where the bug is.\\nAnd ﬁnally , remember the golden rule of debugging: If you are absolutely sure that every-\\nthing in your program is right, and if it still doesn’t work, t hen one of the things that you are\\nabsolutely sure of is wrong.\\n3.3 The while and do..while Statements\\nStatements in Java can be either simple statements or compound statements. Simple\\nstatements, such as assignment statements and subroutine c all statements, are the basic building\\nblocks of a program. Compound statements, such as while loops and if statements, are used to\\norganize simple statements into complex structures, which are called control structures because\\nthey control the order in which the statements are executed. The next ﬁve sections explore\\nthe details of control structures that are available in Java , starting with the while statement\\nand the do..while statement in this section. At the same time, we’ll look at exa mples of\\nprogramming with each control structure and apply the techn iques for designing algorithms'),\n",

CONTROL\\nthat were introduced in the previous section.\\n3.3.1 The while Statement\\nThe while statement was already introduced in Section 3.1. A while loop has the form\\nwhile ( ⟨boolean-expression ⟩ )\\n⟨statement ⟩\\nThe ⟨statement⟩ can, of course, be a block statement consisting of several st atements grouped\\ntogether between a pair of braces. This statement is called t he body of the loop . The body\\nof the loop is repeated as long as the ⟨boolean-expression⟩ is true. This boolean expression is\\ncalled the continuation condition , or more simply the test, of the loop. There are a few\\npoints that might need some clariﬁcation. What happens if th e condition is false in the ﬁrst\\nplace, before the body of the loop is executed even once? In th at case, the body of the loop is\\nnever executed at all. The body of a while loop can be executed any number of times, including\\nzero. What happens if the condition is true, but it becomes fa lse somewhere in the middle of\\nthe loop body? Does the loop end as soon as this happens? It doe sn’t, because the computer\\ncontinues executing the body of the loop until it gets to the e nd. Only then does it jump back\\nto the beginning of the loop and test the condition, and only t hen can the loop end.\\nLet’s look at a typical problem that can be solved using a while loop: ﬁnding the average\\nof a set of positive integers entered by the user. The average is the sum of the integers, divided\\nby the number of integers. The program will ask the user to ent er one integer at a time. It\\nwill keep count of the number of integers entered, and it will keep a running total of all the\\nnumbers it has read so far. Here is a pseudocode algorithm for the program:\\nLet sum = 0\\nLet count = 0\\nwhile there are more integers to process:\\nRead an integer\\nAdd it to the sum\\nCount it\\nDivide sum by count to get the average\\nPrint out the average\\nBut how can we test whether there are more integers to process ? A typical solution is to\\ntell the user to type in zero after all the data have been enter ed. This will work because we\\nare assuming that all the data are positive numbers, so zero i s not a legal data value. The zero\\nis not itself part of the data to be averaged. It’s just there t o mark the end of the real data.\\nA data value used in this way is sometimes called a sentinel value . So now the test in the\\nwhile loop becomes “while the input integer is not zero”. But there is another problem! The\\nﬁrst time the test is evaluated, before the body of the loop ha s ever been executed, no integer\\nhas yet been read. There is no “input integer” yet, so testing whether the input integer is zero\\ndoesn’t make sense. So, we have to do something before the while loop to make sure that the\\ntest makes sense. Setting things up so that the test in a while loop makes sense the ﬁrst time\\nit is executed is called priming the loop . In this case, we can simply read the ﬁrst integer\\nbefore the beginning of the loop. Here is a revised algorithm :\\nLet sum = 0\\nLet count = 0\\nRead an integer\\nwhile the integer is not zero:'),\n",

WHILE AND DO..WHILE 75\\nAdd the integer to the sum\\nCount it\\nRead an integer\\nDivide sum by count to get the average\\nPrint out the average\\nNotice that I’ve rearranged the body of the loop. Since an int eger is read before the loop, the\\nloop has to begin by processing that integer. At the end of the loop, the computer reads a new\\ninteger. The computer then jumps back to the beginning of the loop and tests the integer that\\nit has just read. Note that when the computer ﬁnally reads the sentinel value, the loop ends\\nbefore the sentinel value is processed. It is not added to the sum, and it is not counted. This\\nis the way it’s supposed to work. The sentinel is not part of th e data. The original algorithm,\\neven if it could have been made to work without priming, was in correct since it would have\\nsummed and counted all the integers, including the sentinel . (Since the sentinel is zero, the sum\\nwould still be correct, but the count would be oﬀ by one. Such s o-called oﬀ-by-one errors\\nare very common. Counting turns out to be harder than it looks !)\\nW e can easily turn the algorithm into a complete program. Not e that the program cannot\\nuse the statement “ average = sum/count;” to compute the average. Since sum and count\\nare both variables of type int, the value of sum/count is an integer. The average should be\\na real number. W e’ve seen this problem before: we have to conv ert one of the int values to\\na double to force the computer to compute the quotient as a real number . This can be done\\nby type-casting one of the variables to type double. The type cast “(double)sum” converts\\nthe value of sum to a real number, so in the program the average is computed as “ average =\\n((double)sum) / count;”. Another solution in this case would have been to declare sum to\\nbe a variable of type double in the ﬁrst place.\\nOne other issue is addressed by the program: If the user enter s zero as the ﬁrst input value,\\nthere are no data to process. W e can test for this case by check ing whether count is still equal\\nto zero after the while loop. This might seem like a minor point, but a careful progra mmer\\nshould cover all the bases.\\nHere is the program:\\n/*\\n* This program reads a sequence of positive integers input\\n* by the user, and it will print out the average of those\\n* integers. The user is prompted to enter one integer at a\\n* time. The user must enter a 0 to mark the end of the\\n* data. (The zero is not counted as part of the data to\\n* be averaged.) The program does not check whether the\\n* user’s input is positive, so it will actually work for\\n* both positive and negative input values.\\n*/\\npublic class ComputeAverage {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nint inputNumber; // One of the integers input by the user.\\nint sum; // The sum of the positive integers.\\nint count; // The number of positive integers.\\ndouble average; // The average of the positive integers.\\n/* Initialize the summation and counting variables. */\\nsum = 0;'),\n",

The do..while statement is very similar\\nto the while statement, except that the word “while,” along with the cond ition that it tests,\\nhas been moved to the end. The word “do” is added to mark the beg inning of the loop.

WHILE AND DO..WHILE 77\\nSince the condition is not tested until the end of the loop, th e body of a do loop is always\\nexecuted at least once.\\nF or example, consider the following pseudocode for a game-p laying program. The do loop\\nmakes sense here instead of a while loop because with the do loop, you know there will be at\\nleast one game. Also, the test that is used at the end of the loo p wouldn’t even make sense at\\nthe beginning:\\ndo {\\nPlay a Game\\nAsk user if he wants to play another game\\nRead the user’s response\\n} while ( the user’s response is yes );\\nLet’s convert this into proper Java code. Since I don’t want t o talk about game playing at the\\nmoment, let’s say that we have a class named Checkers, and that the Checkers class contains\\na static member subroutine named playGame() that plays one game of checkers against the\\nuser. Then, the pseudocode “Play a game” can be expressed as t he subroutine call statement\\n“ Checkers.playGame();”. W e need a variable to store the user’s response. The T extIO class\\nmakes it convenient to use a boolean variable to store the answer to a yes/no question. The\\ninput function TextIO.getlnBoolean() allows the user to enter the value as “yes” or “no”.\\n“Y es” is considered to be true, and “no” is considered to be false. So, the algorithm can be\\ncoded as\\nboolean wantsToContinue; // True if user wants to play again .\\ndo {\\nCheckers.playGame();\\nTextIO.put(\"Do you want to play again? \");\\nwantsToContinue = TextIO.getlnBoolean();\\n} while (wantsToContinue == true);\\nWhen the value of the boolean variable is set to false, it is a signal that the loop should end.\\nWhen a boolean variable is used in this way—as a signal that is set in one part of the program\\nand tested in another part—it is sometimes called a ﬂag or ﬂag variable (in the sense of a\\nsignal ﬂag).\\nBy the way , a more-than-usually-pedantic programmer would sneer at the test\\n“ while (wantsToContinue == true)”. This test is exactly equivalent to “ while\\n(wantsToContinue)”. T esting whether “ wantsToContinue == true” is true amounts to the\\nsame thing as testing whether “ wantsToContinue” is true. A little less oﬀensive is an expression\\nof the form “ flag == false”, where flag is a boolean variable. The value of “ flag == false”\\nis exactly the same as the value of “ !flag”, where ! is the boolean negation operator. So\\nyou can write “ while (!flag)” instead of “ while (flag == false)”, and you can write\\n“ if (!flag)” instead of “ if (flag == false)”.\\nAlthough a do..while statement is sometimes more convenient than a while statement,\\nhaving two kinds of loops does not make the language more powe rful. Any problem that can be\\nsolved using do..while loops can also be solved using only while statements, and vice versa.\\nIn fact, if ⟨doSomething⟩ represents any block of program code, then\\ndo {\\n⟨doSomething ⟩\\n} while ( ⟨boolean-expression ⟩ );\\nhas exactly the same eﬀect as'),\n",

Sometimes, it is m ore natural to have the test\\nin the middle of the loop, or to have several tests at diﬀerent places in the same loop. Java\\nprovides a general method for breaking out of the middle of an y loop. It’s called the break\\nstatement, which takes the form\\nbreak;\\nWhen the computer executes a break statement in a loop, it will immediately jump out\\nof the loop. It then continues on to whatever follows the loop in the program. Consider for\\nexample:\\nwhile (true) { // looks like it will run forever!\\nTextIO.put(\"Enter a positive number: \");\\nN = TextIO.getlnInt();\\nif (N > 0) // input is OK; jump out of loop\\nbreak;\\nTextIO.putln(\"Your answer must be > 0.\");\\n}\\n// continue here after break\\nIf the number entered by the user is greater than zero, the break statement will be executed\\nand the computer will jump out of the loop. Otherwise, the com puter will print out “Y our\\nanswer must be > 0.” and will jump back to the start of the loop to read another i nput value.\\n(The ﬁrst line of this loop, “ while (true)” might look a bit strange, but it’s perfectly\\nlegitimate. The condition in a while loop can be any boolean-valued expression. The computer\\nevaluates this expression and checks whether the value is true or false. The boolean literal\\n“ true” is just a boolean expression that always evaluates to true. So “ while (true)” can be\\nused to write an inﬁnite loop, or one that will be terminated b y a break statement.)\\nA break statement terminates the loop that immediately encloses th e break statement. It\\nis possible to have nested loops, where one loop statement is contained inside another . If you\\nuse a break statement inside a nested loop, it will only break out of that loop, not out of'),\n",

THE FOR ST A TEMENT 79\\nthe loop that contains the nested loop. There is something ca lled a labeled break statement\\nthat allows you to specify which loop you want to break. This i s not very common, so I will\\ngo over it quickly . Labels work like this: Y ou can put a label in front of any loop. A label\\nconsists of a simple identiﬁer followed by a colon. F or examp le, a while with a label might\\nlook like “ mainloop: while...”. Inside this loop you can use the labeled break statement\\n“ break mainloop;” to break out of the labeled loop. F or example, here is a code s egment that\\nchecks whether two strings, s1 and s2, have a character in common. If a common character is\\nfound, the value of the ﬂag variable nothingInCommon is set to false, and a labeled break is\\nis used to end the processing at that point:\\nboolean nothingInCommon;\\nnothingInCommon = true; // Assume s1 and s2 have no chars in co mmon.\\nint i,j; // Variables for iterating through the chars in s1 an d s2.\\ni = 0;\\nbigloop: while (i < s1.length()) {\\nj = 0;\\nwhile (j < s2.length()) {\\nif (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) { // s1 and s2 have a comman char.\\nnothingInCommon = false;\\nbreak bigloop; // break out of BOTH loops\\n}\\nj++; // Go on to the next char in s2.\\n}\\ni++; //Go on to the next char in s1.\\n}\\nThe continue statement is related to break, but less commonly used. A continue state-\\nment tells the computer to skip the rest of the current iterat ion of the loop. However, instead\\nof jumping out of the loop altogether, it jumps back to the beg inning of the loop and continues\\nwith the next iteration (including evaluating the loop’s co ntinuation condition to see whether\\nany further iterations are required). As with break, when a continue is in a nested loop, it\\nwill continue the loop that directly contains it; a “labeled continue” can be used to continue\\nthe containing loop instead.\\nbreak and continue can be used in while loops and do..while loops. They can also be\\nused in for loops, which are covered in the next section. In Section 3.6, we’ll see that break can\\nalso be used to break out of a switch statement. A break can occur inside an if statement,\\nbut in that case, it does not mean to break out of the if. Instead, it breaks out of the loop or\\nswitch statement that contains the if statement. If the if statement is not contained inside a\\nloop or switch, then the if statement cannot legally contain a break. A similar consideration\\napplies to continue statements inside ifs.\\n3.4 The for Statement\\nWe turn in this section to another type of loop, the for statement. Any for loop is\\nequivalent to some while loop, so the language doesn’t get any additional power by hav ing for\\nstatements. But for a certain type of problem, a for loop can be easier to construct and easier\\nto read than the corresponding while loop. It’s quite possible that in real programs, for loops\\nactually outnumber while loops.'),\n",

This keeps everything involved in the “control” of the loop in one place, which\\nhelps makes the loop easier to read and understand. The for loop is executed in exactly the\\nsame way as the original code: The initialization part is exe cuted once, before the loop begins.\\nThe continuation condition is executed before each executi on of the loop, and the loop ends\\nwhen this condition is false. The update part is executed at the end of each execution of th e\\nloop, just before jumping back to check the condition.\\nThe formal syntax of the for statement is as follows:\\nfor ( ⟨initialization ⟩; ⟨continuation-condition ⟩; ⟨update ⟩ )\\n⟨statement ⟩\\nor, using a block statement:\\nfor ( ⟨initialization ⟩; ⟨continuation-condition ⟩; ⟨update ⟩ ) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nThe ⟨continuation-condition⟩ must be a boolean-valued expression. The ⟨initialization⟩ can\\nbe any expression, but is usually an assignment statement. T he ⟨update⟩ can also be any\\nexpression, but is usually an increment, a decrement, or an a ssignment statement. Any of\\nthe three can be empty . If the continuation condition is empt y , it is treated as if it were\\n“ true,” so the loop will be repeated forever or until it ends for som e other reason, such as\\na break statement.

THE FOR ST A TEMENT 81\\nUsually , the initialization part of a for statement assigns a value to some variable, and the\\nupdate changes the value of that variable with an assignment statement or with an increment\\nor decrement operation. The value of the variable is tested i n the continuation condition, and\\nthe loop ends when this condition evaluates to false. A variable used in this way is called a\\nloop control variable . In the for statement given above, the loop control variable is years.\\nCertainly , the most common type of for loop is the counting loop , where a loop control\\nvariable takes on all integer values between some minimum an d some maximum value. A\\ncounting loop has the form\\nfor ( ⟨variable ⟩ = ⟨min ⟩; ⟨variable ⟩ <= ⟨max ⟩; ⟨variable ⟩++ ) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nwhere ⟨min⟩and ⟨max ⟩are integer-valued expressions (usually constants). The ⟨variable⟩takes\\non the values ⟨min⟩, ⟨min⟩+1, ⟨min⟩+2, . . . , ⟨max ⟩. The value of the loop control variable is\\noften used in the body of the loop. The for loop at the beginning of this section is a counting\\nloop in which the loop control variable, years, takes on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Here is an even\\nsimpler example, in which the numbers 1, 2, . . . , 10 are displa yed on standard output:\\nfor ( N = 1 ; N <= 10 ; N++ )\\nSystem.out.println( N );\\nF or various reasons, Java programmers like to start countin g at 0 instead of 1, and they\\ntend to use a “ <” in the condition, rather than a “ <=”. The following variation of the above\\nloop prints out the ten numbers 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9:\\nfor ( N = 0 ; N < 10 ; N++ )\\nSystem.out.println( N );\\nUsing < instead of <= in the test, or vice versa, is a common source of oﬀ-by-one err ors in\\nprograms. Y ou should always stop and think, Do I want the ﬁnal value to be processed or not?\\nIt’s easy to count down from 10 to 1 instead of counting up. Jus t start with 10, decrement\\nthe loop control variable instead of incrementing it, and co ntinue as long as the variable is\\ngreater than or equal to one.\\nfor ( N = 10 ; N >= 1 ; N-- )\\nSystem.out.println( N );\\nNow, in fact, the oﬃcial syntax of a for statemenent actually allows both the initialization\\npart and the update part to consist of several expressions, s eparated by commas.

THE FOR ST A TEMENT 83\\n3.4.2 Example: Counting Divisors\\nLet’s look at a less trivial problem that can be solved with a for loop. If N and D are positive\\nintegers, we say that D is a divisor of N if the remainder when D is divided into N is zero.\\n(Equivalently , we could say that N is an even multiple of D.) In terms of Java programming, D\\nis a divisor of N if N % D is zero.\\nLet’s write a program that inputs a positive integer, N, from the user and computes how\\nmany diﬀerent divisors N has. The numbers that could possibly be divisors of N are 1, 2, . . . , N.\\nT o compute the number of divisors of N, we can just test each possible divisor of N and count\\nthe ones that actually do divide N evenly . In pseudocode, the algorithm takes the form\\nGet a positive integer, N, from the user\\nLet divisorCount = 0\\nfor each number, testDivisor, in the range from 1 to N:\\nif testDivisor is a divisor of N:\\nCount it by adding 1 to divisorCount\\nOutput the count\\nThis algorithm displays a common programming pattern that i s used when some, but not all,\\nof a sequence of items are to be processed. The general patter n is\\nfor each item in the sequence:\\nif the item passes the test:\\nprocess it\\nThe for loop in our divisor-counting algorithm can be translated in to Java code as\\nfor (testDivisor = 1; testDivisor <= N; testDivisor++) {\\nif ( N % testDivisor == 0 )\\ndivisorCount++;\\n}\\nOn a modern computer, this loop can be executed very quickly . It is not impossible to run\\nit even for the largest legal int value, 2147483647. (If you wanted to run it for even larger\\nvalues, you could use variables of type long rather than int.) However, it does take a noticeable\\namount of time for very large numbers. So when I implemented t his algorithm, I decided to\\noutput a dot every time the computer has tested one million po ssible divisors. In the improved\\nversion of the program, there are two types of counting going on. W e have to count the number\\nof divisors and we also have to count the number of possible di visors that have been tested.\\nSo the program needs two counters. When the second counter re aches 1000000, the program\\noutputs a ’.’ and resets the counter to zero so that we can star t counting the next group of one\\nmillion. Reverting to pseudocode, the algorithm now looks l ike\\nGet a positive integer, N, from the user\\nLet divisorCount = 0 // Number of divisors found.\\nLet numberTested = 0 // Number of possible divisors tested\\n// since the last period was output.\\nfor each number, testDivisor, in the range from 1 to N:\\nif testDivisor is a divisor of N:\\nCount it by adding 1 to divisorCount\\nAdd 1 to numberTested\\nif numberTested is 1000000:\\nprint out a ’.’\\nLet numberTested = 0\\nOutput the count'),\n",

THE FOR ST A TEMENT 85\\n3.4.3 Nested for Loops\\nControl structures in Java are statements that contain stat ements. In particular, control struc-\\ntures can contain control structures. Y ou’ve already seen s everal examples of if statements\\ninside loops, and one example of a while loop inside another while, but any combination of one\\ncontrol structure inside another is possible. W e say that on e structure is nested inside another.\\nY ou can even have multiple levels of nesting, such as a while loop inside an if statement inside\\nanother while loop. The syntax of Java does not set a limit on the number of le vels of nesting.\\nAs a practical matter, though, it’s diﬃcult to understand a p rogram that has more than a few\\nlevels of nesting.\\nNested for loops arise naturally in many algorithms, and it is importan t to understand how\\nthey work. Let’s look at a couple of examples. First, conside r the problem of printing out a\\nmultiplication table like this one:\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\\n3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36\\n4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48\\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60\\n6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 66 72\\n7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 77 84\\n8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 88 96\\n9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 99 108\\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120\\n11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 110 121 132\\n12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 108 120 132 144\\nThe data in the table are arranged into 12 rows and 12 columns. The process of printing them\\nout can be expressed in a pseudocode algorithm as\\nfor each rowNumber = 1, 2, 3, ..., 12:\\nPrint the first twelve multiples of rowNumber on one line\\nOutput a carriage return\\nThe ﬁrst step in the for loop can itself be expressed as a for loop. W e can expand “Print the\\nﬁrst twelve multiples of rowNumber on one line” as:\\nfor N = 1, 2, 3, ..., 12:\\nPrint N * rowNumber\\nso a reﬁned algorithm for printing the table has one for loop nested inside another:\\nfor each rowNumber = 1, 2, 3, ..., 12:\\nfor N = 1, 2, 3, ..., 12:\\nPrint N * rowNumber\\nOutput a carriage return\\nW e want to print the output in neat columns, with each output n umber taking up four spaces.\\nThis can be done using formatted output with format speciﬁer %4d. Assuming that rowNumber\\nand N have been declared to be variables of type int, the algorithm can be expressed in Java as\\nfor ( rowNumber = 1; rowNumber <= 12; rowNumber++ ) {\\nfor ( N = 1; N <= 12; N++ ) {\\n// print in 4-character columns\\nSystem.out.printf( \"%4d;\", N * rowNumber ); // No carriage r eturn !\\n}'),\n",

CONTROL\\nSystem.out.println(); // Add a carriage return at end of the line.\\n}\\nThis section has been weighed down with lots of examples of nu merical processing. F or our\\nnext example, let’s do some text processing. Consider the pr oblem of ﬁnding which of the 26\\nletters of the alphabet occur in a given string. F or example, the letters that occur in “Hello\\nW orld” are D, E, H, L, O, R, and W. More speciﬁcally , we will wri te a program that will list all\\nthe letters contained in a string and will also count the numb er of diﬀerent letters. The string\\nwill be input by the user. Let’s start with a pseudocode algor ithm for the program.\\nAsk the user to input a string\\nRead the response into a variable, str\\nLet count = 0 (for counting the number of different letters)\\nfor each letter of the alphabet:\\nif the letter occurs in str:\\nPrint the letter\\nAdd 1 to count\\nOutput the count\\nSince we want to process the entire line of text that is entere d by the user, we’ll use\\nTextIO.getln() to read it. The line of the algorithm that reads “for each lett er of the al-\\nphabet” can be expressed as “ for (letter=’A’; letter<=’Z’; letter++)”. But the body\\nof this for loop needs more thought. How do we check whether the given let ter, letter, occurs\\nin str? One idea is to look at each character in the string in turn, an d check whether that\\ncharacter is equal to letter. W e can get the i-th character of str with the function call\\nstr.charAt(i), where i ranges from 0 to str.length() - 1. One more diﬃculty: A letter\\nsuch as ’A’ can occur in str in either upper or lower case, ’A’ or ’a’. W e have to check for b oth\\nof these. But we can avoid this diﬃculty by converting str to upper case before processing\\nit. Then, we only have to check for the upper case letter. W e ca n now ﬂesh out the algorithm\\nfully . Note the use of break in the nested for loop. It is required to avoid printing or counting\\na given letter more than once (in the case where it occurs more than once in the string). The\\nbreak statement breaks out of the inner for loop, but not the outer for loop. Upon executing\\nthe break, the computer continues the outer loop with the next value of letter.\\nAsk the user to input a string\\nRead the response into a variable, str\\nConvert str to upper case\\nLet count = 0\\nfor letter = ’A’, ’B’, ..., ’Z’:\\nfor i = 0, 1, ..., str.length()-1:\\nif letter == str.charAt(i):\\nPrint letter\\nAdd 1 to count\\nbreak // jump out of the loop\\nOutput the count\\nHere is the complete program:\\n/**\\n* This program reads a line of text entered by the user.\\n* It prints a list of the letters that occur in the text,\\n* and it reports how many different letters were found.\\n*/'),\n",

The built-in function str.indexOf(letter) will return -1 if letter does not occur in\\nthe string. It returns a number greater than or equal to zero i f it does occur. So, we could\\ncheck whether letter occurs in str simply by checking “ if (str.indexOf(letter) >= 0)”.\\nIf we used this technique in the above program, we wouldn’t ne ed a nested for loop. This gives\\nyou a preview of how subroutines can be used to deal with compl exity .\\n3.4.4 Enums and for-each Loops\\nJava 5.0 introduces a new “enhanced” form of the for loop that is designed to be convenient\\nfor processing data structures. A data structure is a collection of data items, considered as\\na unit. F or example, a list is a data structure that consists simply of a sequence of item s.\\nThe enhanced for loop makes it easy to apply the same processing to every eleme nt of a list\\nor other data structure. Data structures are a major topic in computer science, but we won’t\\nencounter them in any serious way until Chapter 7. However, o ne of the applications of the\\nenhanced for loop is to enum types, and so we consider it brieﬂy here. (Enums were introdu ced\\nin Subsection 2.3.3.)'),\n",

CONTROL\\nThe enhanced for loop can be used to perform the same processi ng on each of the enum\\nconstants that are the possible values of an enumerated type . The syntax for doing this is:\\nfor ( ⟨enum-type-name ⟩ ⟨ variable-name ⟩ : ⟨enum-type-name ⟩.values() )\\n⟨statement ⟩\\nor\\nfor ( ⟨enum-type-name ⟩ ⟨ variable-name ⟩ : ⟨enum-type-name ⟩.values() ) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nIf MyEnum is the name of any enumerated type, then MyEnum.values() is a function call that\\nreturns a list containing all of the values of the enum. ( values() is a static member function\\nin MyEnum and of any other enum.) F or this enumerated type, the for loop would have the\\nform:\\nfor ( MyEnum ⟨variable-name ⟩ : MyEnum.values() )\\n⟨statement ⟩\\nThe intent of this is to execute the ⟨statement⟩ once for each of the possible values of the\\nMyEnum type. The ⟨variable-name⟩ is the loop control variable. In the ⟨statement⟩, it repre-\\nsents the enumerated type value that is currently being proc essed. This variable should not be\\ndeclared before the for loop; it is essentially being declared in the loop itself.\\nT o give a concrete example, suppose that the following enume rated type has been deﬁned\\nto represent the days of the week:\\nenum Day { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY }\\nThen we could write:\\nfor ( Day d : Day.values() ) {\\nSystem.out.print( d );\\nSystem.out.print(\" is day number \");\\nSystem.out.println( d.ordinal() );\\n}\\nDay.values() represents the list containing the seven constants that mak e up the enumerated\\ntype. The ﬁrst time through this loop, the value of d would be the ﬁrst enumerated type value\\nDay.MONDAY, which has ordinal number 0, so the output would be “MONDA Y is day number 0”.\\nThe second time through the loop, the value of d would be Day.TUESDAY, and so on through\\nDay.SUNDAY. The body of the loop is executed once for each item in the list Day.values(),\\nwith d taking on each of those values in turn. The full output from th is loop would be:\\nMONDAY is day number 0\\nTUESDAY is day number 1\\nWEDNESDAY is day number 2\\nTHURSDAY is day number 3\\nFRIDAY is day number 4\\nSATURDAY is day number 5\\nSUNDAY is day number 6\\nSince the intent of the enhanced for loop is to do something “f or each” item in a data\\nstructure, it is often called a for-each loop . The syntax for this type of loop is unfortunate. It\\nwould be better if it were written something like “ foreach Day d in Day.values()”, which\\nconveys the meaning much better and is similar to the syntax u sed in other programming\\nlanguages for similar types of loops. It’s helpful to think o f the colon (:) in the loop as meaning\\n“in.”'),\n",

THE IF ST A TEMENT 89\\n3.5 The if Statement\\nThe first of the two branching statements in Java is the if statement, which you\\nhave already seen in Section 3.1. It takes the form\\nif (⟨boolean-expression ⟩)\\n⟨statement-1 ⟩\\nelse\\n⟨statement-2 ⟩\\nAs usual, the statements inside an if statements can be blocks. The if statement represents\\na two-way branch. The else part of an if statement—consisting of the word “else” and the\\nstatement that follows it—can be omitted.\\n3.5.1 The Dangling else Problem\\nNow, an if statement is, in particular, a statement. This means that ei ther ⟨statement-1 ⟩\\nor ⟨statement-2 ⟩ in the above if statement can itself be an if statement. A problem arises,\\nhowever, if ⟨statement-1 ⟩ is an if statement that has no else part. This special case is\\neﬀectively forbidden by the syntax of Java. Suppose, for exa mple, that you type\\nif ( x > 0 )\\nif (y > 0)\\nSystem.out.println(\"First case\");\\nelse\\nSystem.out.println(\"Second case\");\\nNow, remember that the way you’ve indented this doesn’t mean anything at all to the computer.\\nY ou might think that the else part is the second half of your “ if (x > 0)” statement, but\\nthe rule that the computer follows attaches the else to “ if (y > 0)”, which is closer. That\\nis, the computer reads your statement as if it were formatted :\\nif ( x > 0 )\\nif (y > 0)\\nSystem.out.println(\"First case\");\\nelse\\nSystem.out.println(\"Second case\");\\nY ou can force the computer to use the other interpretation by enclosing the nested if in a\\nblock:\\nif ( x > 0 ) {\\nif (y > 0)\\nSystem.out.println(\"First case\");\\n}\\nelse\\nSystem.out.println(\"Second case\");\\nThese two if statements have diﬀerent meanings: In the case when x <= 0, the ﬁrst statement\\ndoesn’t print anything, but the second statement prints “Se cond case.”.\\n3.5.2 The if...else if Construction\\nMuch more interesting than this technicality is the case whe re ⟨statement-2 ⟩, the else part\\nof the if statement, is itself an if statement. The statement would look like this (perhaps\\nwithout the ﬁnal else part):'),\n",

This statement is called\\na multi-way branch because only one of the statements will be executed. The ﬁnal else part\\ncan be omitted. In that case, if all the boolean expressions a re false, none of the statements is\\nexecuted. Of course, each of the statements can be a block, co nsisting of a number of statements\\nenclosed between { and }. (Admittedly , there is lot of syntax here; as you study and pr actice,\\nyou’ll become comfortable with it.)\\n3.5.3 If Statement Examples\\nAs an example of using if statements, lets suppose that x, y, and z are variables of type int,\\nand that each variable has already been assigned a value. Con sider the problem of printing out\\nthe values of the three variables in increasing order. F or ex amples, if the values are 42, 17, and\\n20, then the output should be in the order 17, 20, 42.\\nOne way to approach this is to ask, where does x belong in the list? It comes ﬁrst if it’s\\nless than both y and z. It comes last if it’s greater than both y and z. Otherwise, it comes in\\nthe middle. W e can express this with a 3-way if statement, but we still have to worry about\\nthe order in which y and z should be printed. In pseudocode,\\nif (x < y && x < z) {\\noutput x, followed by y and z in their correct order\\n}\\nelse if (x > y && x > z) {\\noutput y and z in their correct order, followed by x\\n}\\nelse {\\noutput x in between y and z in their correct order\\n}\\nDetermining the relative order of y and z requires another if statement, so this becomes\\nif (x < y && x < z) { // x comes first\\nif (y < z)\\nSystem.out.println( x + \" \" + y + \" \" + z );\\nelse\\nSystem.out.println( x + \" \" + z + \" \" + y );\\n}\\nelse if (x > y && x > z) { // x comes last\\nif (y < z)\\nSystem.out.println( y + \" \" + z + \" \" + x );\\nelse\\nSystem.out.println( z + \" \" + y + \" \" + x );\\n}\\nelse { // x in the middle\\nif (y < z)\\nSystem.out.println( y + \" \" + x + \" \" + z);\\nelse'),\n",

CONTROL\\nSystem.out.println( z + \" \" + x + \" \" + y);\\n}\\nY ou might check that this code will work correctly even if som e of the values are the same. If\\nthe values of two variables are the same, it doesn’t matter wh ich order you print them in.\\nNote, by the way , that even though you can say in English “if x i s less than y and z,”,\\nyou can’t say in Java “ if (x < y && z)”. The && operator can only be used between boolean\\nvalues, so you have to make separate tests, x<y and x<z, and then combine the two tests with\\n&&.\\nThere is an alternative approach to this problem that begins by asking, “which order should\\nx and y be printed in?” Once that’s known, you only have to decide whe re to stick in z. This\\nline of thought leads to diﬀerent Java code:\\nif ( x < y ) { // x comes before y\\nif ( z < x ) // z comes first\\nSystem.out.println( z + \" \" + x + \" \" + y);\\nelse if ( z > y ) // z comes last\\nSystem.out.println( x + \" \" + y + \" \" + z);\\nelse // z is in the middle\\nSystem.out.println( x + \" \" + z + \" \" + y);\\n}\\nelse { // y comes before x\\nif ( z < y ) // z comes first\\nSystem.out.println( z + \" \" + y + \" \" + x);\\nelse if ( z > x ) // z comes last\\nSystem.out.println( y + \" \" + x + \" \" + z);\\nelse // z is in the middle\\nSystem.out.println( y + \" \" + z + \" \" + x);\\n}\\nOnce again, we see how the same problem can be solved in many di ﬀerent ways. The two\\napproaches to this problem have not exhausted all the possib ilities. F or example, you might\\nstart by testing whether x is greater than y. If so, you could swap their values. Once you’ve\\ndone that, you know that x should be printed before y.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nFinally , let’s write a complete program that uses an if statement in an interesting way . I\\nwant a program that will convert measurements of length from one unit of measurement to\\nanother, such as miles to yards or inches to feet. So far, the p roblem is extremely under-\\nspeciﬁed. Let’s say that the program will only deal with meas urements in inches, feet, yards,\\nand miles. It would be easy to extend it later to deal with othe r units. The user will type in\\na measurement in one of these units, such as “17 feet” or “2.73 miles”. The output will show\\nthe length in terms of each of the four units of measure. (This is easier than asking the u ser\\nwhich units to use in the output.) An outline of the process is\\nRead the user’s input measurement and units of measure\\nExpress the measurement in inches, feet, yards, and miles\\nDisplay the four results\\nThe program can read both parts of the user’s input from the sa me line by using\\nTextIO.getDouble() to read the numerical measurement and TextIO.getlnWord() to read\\nthe unit of measure. The conversion into diﬀerent units of me asure can be simpliﬁed by ﬁrst'),\n",

THE IF ST A TEMENT 93\\nconverting the user’s input into inches. F rom there, the num ber of inches can easily be con-\\nverted into feet, yards, and miles. Before converting into i nches, we have to test the input to\\ndetermine which unit of measure the user has speciﬁed:\\nLet measurement = TextIO.getDouble()\\nLet units = TextIO.getlnWord()\\nif the units are inches\\nLet inches = measurement\\nelse if the units are feet\\nLet inches = measurement * 12 // 12 inches per foot\\nelse if the units are yards\\nLet inches = measurement * 36 // 36 inches per yard\\nelse if the units are miles\\nLet inches = measurement * 12 * 5280 // 5280 feet per mile\\nelse\\nThe units are illegal!\\nPrint an error message and stop processing\\nLet feet = inches / 12.0\\nLet yards = inches / 36.0\\nLet miles = inches / (12.0 * 5280.0)\\nDisplay the results\\nSince units is a String, we can use units.equals(\"inches\") to check whether the spec-\\niﬁed unit of measure is “inches”. However, it would be nice to allow the units to be spec-\\niﬁed as “inch” or abbreviated to “in”. T o allow these three po ssibilities, we can check if\\n(units.equals(\"inches\") || units.equals(\"inch\") || units.equals(\"in\")). It would\\nalso be nice to allow upper case letters, as in “Inches” or “IN ”. W e can do this by converting\\nunits to lower case before testing it or by substituting the functi on units.equalsIgnoreCase\\nfor units.equals.\\nIn my ﬁnal program, I decided to make things more interesting by allowing the user to enter\\na whole sequence of measurements. The program will end only w hen the user inputs 0. T o do\\nthis, I just have to wrap the above algorithm inside a while loop, and make sure that the loop\\nends when the user inputs a 0. Here’s the complete program:\\n/*\\n* This program will convert measurements expressed in inches,\\n* feet, yards, or miles into each of the possible units of\\n* measure.

If we had used an “f” format\\nspeciﬁer such as %12.5f, the output would be in decimal form with 5 digits after the de cimal\\npoint. This would print the number 0.0000000007454 as 0.00000, with no signiﬁcant digits\\nat all! With the “g” format speciﬁer, the output would be 7.454e-10.)\\n3.5.4 The Empty Statement\\nAs a ﬁnal note in this section, I will mention one more type of s tatement in Java: the empty\\nstatement. This is a statement that consists simply of a semicolon and w hich tells the computer\\nto do nothing. The existence of the empty statement makes the following legal, even though\\nyou would not ordinarily see a semicolon after a } :\\nif (x < 0) {\\nx = -x;\\n};\\nThe semicolon is legal after the }, but the computer considers it to be an empty statement,\\nnot part of the if statement. Occasionally , you might ﬁnd yourself using the e mpty statement\\nwhen what you mean is, in fact, “do nothing”. F or example, the rather contrived if statement\\nif ( done )\\n; // Empty statement\\nelse\\nSystem.out.println( \"Not done yet. );\\ndoes nothing when the boolean variable done is true, and prints out “Not done yet” when\\nit is false. Y ou can’t just leave out the semicolon in this exa mple, since Java syntax requires\\nan actual statement between the if and the else. I prefer, though, to use an empty block,\\nconsisting of { and } with nothing between, for such cases.\\nOccasionally , stray empty statements can cause annoying, h ard-to-ﬁnd errors in a program.\\nF or example, the following program segment prints out “Hell o” just once, not ten times:\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; i++);\\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello\");'),\n",

CONTROL\\nWhy? Because the “;” at the end of the ﬁrst line is a statement, and it is this statement\\nthat is executed ten times. The System.out.println statement is not really inside the for\\nstatement at all, so it is executed just once, after the for loop has completed.\\n3.6 The switch Statement\\nThe second branching statement in Java is the switch statement, which is introduced\\nin this section. The switch statement is used far less often than the if statement, but it is\\nsometimes useful for expressing a certain type of multi-way branch.\\n3.6.1 The Basic switch Statement\\nA switch statement allows you to test the value of an expressi on and, depending on that value,\\nto jump directly to some location within the switch statemen t. Only expressions of certain\\ntypes can be used. The value of the expression can be one of the primitive integer types int,\\nshort, or byte. It can be the primitive char type. Or, as we will see later in this section,\\nit can be an enumuerated type. In particular, the expression cannot be a String or a real\\nnumber. The positions that you can jump to are marked with case labels that take the\\nform: “case ⟨constant⟩:”. This marks the position the computer jumps to when the exp ression\\nevaluates to the given ⟨constant⟩. As the ﬁnal case in a switch statement you can, optionally ,\\nuse the label “default:”, which provides a default jump poin t that is used when the value of the\\nexpression is not listed in any case label.\\nA switch statement, as it is most oftern used, has the form:\\nswitch (⟨expression ⟩) {\\ncase ⟨constant-1 ⟩:\\n⟨statements-1 ⟩\\nbreak;\\ncase ⟨constant-2 ⟩:\\n⟨statements-2 ⟩\\nbreak;\\n.\\n. // (more cases)\\n.\\ncase ⟨constant-N ⟩:\\n⟨statements-N ⟩\\nbreak;\\ndefault: // optional default case\\n⟨statements-(N+1) ⟩\\n} // end of switch statement\\nThe break statements are technically optional. The eﬀect of a break is to make the computer\\njump to the end of the switch statement. If you leave out the br eak statement, the computer\\nwill just forge ahead after completing one case and will exec ute the statements associated with\\nthe next case label. This is rarely what you want, but it is leg al. (I will note here—although\\nyou won’t understand it until you get to the next chapter—tha t inside a subroutine, the break\\nstatement is sometimes replaced by a return statement.)\\nNote that you can leave out one of the groups of statements ent irely (including the break).\\nY ou then have two case labels in a row, containing two diﬀeren t constants. This just means'),\n",

THE SWITCH ST A TEMENT 97\\nthat the computer will jump to the same place and perform the s ame action for each of the two\\nconstants.\\nHere is an example of a switch statement. This is not a useful e xample, but it should be\\neasy for you to follow. Note, by the way , that the constants in the case labels don’t have to be\\nin any particular order, as long as they are all diﬀerent:\\nswitch ( N ) { // (Assume N is an integer variable.)\\ncase 1:\\nSystem.out.println(\"The number is 1.\");\\nbreak;\\ncase 2:\\ncase 4:\\ncase 8:\\nSystem.out.println(\"The number is 2, 4, or 8.\");\\nSystem.out.println(\"(That’s a power of 2!)\");\\nbreak;\\ncase 3:\\ncase 6:\\ncase 9:\\nSystem.out.println(\"The number is 3, 6, or 9.\");\\nSystem.out.println(\"(That’s a multiple of 3!)\");\\nbreak;\\ncase 5:\\nSystem.out.println(\"The number is 5.\");\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nSystem.out.println(\"The number is 7 or is outside the range 1 to 9.\");\\n}\\nThe switch statement is pretty primitive as control structu res go, and it’s easy to make mis-\\ntakes when you use it. Java takes all its control structures d irectly from the older programming\\nlanguages C and C++. The switch statement is certainly one pl ace where the designers of Java\\nshould have introduced some improvements.\\n3.6.2 Menus and switch Statements\\nOne application of switch statements is in processing menus. A menu is a list of options .\\nThe user selects one of the options. The computer has to respo nd to each possible choice in a\\ndiﬀerent way . If the options are numbered 1, 2, . . . , then the n umber of the chosen option can\\nbe used in a switch statement to select the proper response.\\nIn a T extIO-based program, the menu can be presented as a numbered list o f options, and\\nthe user can choose an option by typing in its number. Here is a n example that could be used\\nin a variation of the LengthConverter example from the previous section:\\nint optionNumber; // Option number from menu, selected by us er.\\ndouble measurement; // A numerical measurement, input by the user.\\n// The unit of measurement depends on which\\n// option the user has selected.\\ndouble inches; // The same measurement, converted into inch es.\\n/* Display menu and get user’s selected option number. */\\nTextIO.putln(\"What unit of measurement does your input use?\");\\nTextIO.putln();'),\n",

Illegal option number! I quit!\");\\nSystem.exit(1);\\n} // end switch\\n/* Now go on to convert inches to feet, yards, and miles... */\\n3.6.3 Enums in switch Statements\\nThe type of the expression in a switch can be an enumerated type. In that case, the constants\\nin the case labels must be values from the enumerated type. F or example, if the type of the\\nexpression is the enumerated type Season deﬁned by\\nenum Season { SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER }\\nthen the constants in the case label must be chosen from among the values Season.SPRING,\\nSeason.SUMMER, Season.FALL, or Season.WINTER. However, there is another quirk in the syn-\\ntax: when an enum constant is used in a case label, only the simple name, such as “ SPRING”\\ncan be used, not the full name “ Season.SPRING”. Of course, the computer already knows that\\nthe value in the case label must belong to the enumerated type, since it can tell th at from the\\ntype of expression used, so there is really no need to specify the type name in the constant. As\\nan example, suppose that currentSeason is a variable of type Season. Then we could have the\\nswitch statement:'),\n",

Recall that t he value of the expression\\n(int)(3*Math.random()) is one of the integers 0, 1, or 2, selected at random with equal\\nprobability , so the switch statement below will assign one of the values \"Rock\", \"Scissors\",\\n\"Paper\" to computerMove, with probability 1/3 for each case. Although the switch sta tement\\nin this example is correct, this code segment as a whole illus trates a subtle syntax error that\\nsometimes comes up:\\nString computerMove;\\nswitch ( (int)(3*Math.random()) ) {\\ncase 0:\\ncomputerMove = \"Rock\";\\nbreak;\\ncase 1:\\ncomputerMove = \"Scissors\";\\nbreak;\\ncase 2:\\ncomputerMove = \"Paper\";\\nbreak;\\n}\\nSystem.out.println(\"Computer’s move is \" + computerMove); // ERROR!\\nY ou probably haven’t spotted the error, since it’s not an err or from a human point of view.\\nThe computer reports the last line to be an error, because the variable computerMove might\\nnot have been assigned a value. In Java, it is only legal to use the value of a variable if a\\nvalue has already been deﬁnitely assigned to that variable. This means that the computer\\nmust be able to prove, just from looking at the code when the pr ogram is compiled, that the\\nvariable must have been assigned a value. Unfortunately , th e computer only has a few simple\\nrules that it can apply to make the determination. In this cas e, it sees a switch statement in\\nwhich the type of expression is int and in which the cases that are covered are 0, 1, and 2. F or\\nother values of the expression, computerMove is never assigned a value. So, the computer thinks\\ncomputerMove might still be undeﬁned after the switch statement. Now, in fact, this isn’t true:\\n0, 1, and 2 are actually the only possible values of the expres sion (int)(3*Math.random()),\\nbut the computer isn’t smart enough to ﬁgure that out. The eas iest way to ﬁx the problem is'),\n",

F or example, the following two if statements\\nboth do the same thing as the switch statement given above, but only the one on the right\\ndeﬁnitely assigns a value to computerMove:\\nString computerMove; String computerMove;\\nint rand; int rand;\\nrand = (int)(3*Math.random()); rand = (int)(3*Math.rando m());\\nif ( rand == 0 ) if ( rand == 0 )\\ncomputerMove = \"Rock\"; computerMove = \"Rock\";\\nelse if ( rand == 1 ) else if ( rand == 1 )\\ncomputerMove = \"Scissors\"; computerMove = \"Scissors\";\\nelse if ( rand == 2 ) else\\ncomputerMove = \"Paper\"; computerMove = \"Paper\";\\nIn the code on the left, the test “ if ( rand == 2 )” in the ﬁnal else clause is unnecessary\\nbecause if rand is not 0 or 1, the only remaining possibility is that rand == 2. The computer,\\nhowever, can’t ﬁgure that out.\\n3.7 Introduction to Exceptions and try ..catch\\nIn addition to the control structures that determine the normal ﬂow of control in a pro-\\ngram, Java has a way to deal with “exceptional” cases that thr ow the ﬂow of control oﬀ its\\nnormal track. When an error occurs during the execution of a p rogram, the default behavior\\nis to terminate the program and to print an error message. How ever, Java makes it possible to\\n“catch” such errors and program a response diﬀerent from sim ply letting the program crash.\\nThis is done with the try..catch statement. In this section, we will take a preliminary , inco m-\\nplete look at using try..catch to handle errors. Error handling is a complex topic, which we\\nwill return to in Chapter 8.\\n3.7.1 Exceptions\\nThe term exception is used to refer to the type of error that one might want to hand le with\\na try..catch. An exception is an exception to the normal ﬂow of control in t he program.\\nThe term is used in preference to “error” because in some case s, an exception might not be\\nconsidered to be an error at all. Y ou can sometimes think of an exception as just another way\\nto organize a program.\\nExceptions in Java are represented as objects of type Exception. Actual exceptions are de-\\nﬁned by subclasses of Exception. Diﬀerent subclasses represent diﬀerent types of exceptio ns W e\\nwill look at only two types of exception in this section: NumberFormatException and IllegalArgu-\\nmentException.\\nA NumberFormatException can occur when an attempt is made to convert a string\\ninto a number. Such conversions are done by the functions Integer.parseInt\\nand Integer.parseDouble. (See Subsection 2.5.7.) Consider the function call\\nInteger.parseInt(str) where str is a variable of type String. If the value of str is the\\nstring \"42\", then the function call will correctly convert the string in to the int 42. However,'),\n",

EXCEPTIONS AND TR Y..CA TCH 101\\nif the value of str is, say , \"fred\", the function call will fail because \"fred\" is not a legal\\nstring representation of an int value. In this case, an exception of type NumberFormatException\\noccurs. If nothing is done to handle the exception, the progr am will crash.\\nAn IllegalArgumentException can occur when an illegal value is passed as a parameter to a\\nsubroutine. F or example, if a subroutine requires that a par ameter be greater than or equal to\\nzero, an IllegalArgumentException might occur when a negative value is passed to the subroutine .\\nHow to respond to the illegal value is up to the person who wrot e the subroutine, so we\\ncan’t simply say that every illegal parameter value will res ult in an IllegalArgumentException.\\nHowever, it is a common response.\\nOne case where an IllegalArgumentException can occur is in the valueOf function of an\\nenumerated type. Recall from Subsection 2.3.3 that this fun ction tries to convert a string into\\none of the values of the enumerated type. If the string that is passed as a parameter to valueOf\\nis not the name of one of the enumerated type’s values, then an IllegalArgumentException occurs.\\nF or example, given the enumerated type\\nenum Toss { HEADS, TAILS }\\nToss.valueOf(\"HEADS\") correctly returns the value Toss.HEADS, while Toss.valueOf(\"FEET\")\\nresults in an IllegalArgumentException.\\n3.7.2 try ..catch\\nWhen an exception occurs, we say that the exception is “throw n”. F or example, we say that\\nInteger.parseInt(str) throws an exception of type NumberFormatException when the value\\nof str is illegal. When an exception is thrown, it is possible to “ca tch” the exception and\\nprevent it from crashing the program. This is done with a try..catch statement. In somewhat\\nsimpliﬁed form, the syntax for a try..catch is:\\ntry {\\n⟨statements-1 ⟩\\n}\\ncatch ( ⟨exception-class-name ⟩ ⟨ variable-name ⟩ ) {\\n⟨statements-2 ⟩\\n}\\nThe ⟨exception-class-name⟩ could be NumberFormatException, IllegalArgumentException, or\\nsome other exception class. When the computer executes this statement, it executes the state-\\nments in the try part. If no error occurs during the execution of ⟨statements-1 ⟩, then the\\ncomputer just skips over the catch part and proceeds with the rest of the program. However,\\nif an exception of type ⟨exception-class-name⟩ occurs during the execution of ⟨statements-1 ⟩,\\nthe computer immediately jumps to the catch part and executes ⟨statements-2 ⟩, skipping any\\nremaining statements in ⟨statements-1 ⟩. During the execution of ⟨statements-2 ⟩, the ⟨variable-\\nname⟩ represents the exception object, so that you can, for exampl e, print it out. At the end\\nof the catch part, the computer proceeds with the rest of the program; the exception has been\\ncaught and handled and does not crash the program. Note that o nly one type of exception is\\ncaught; if some other type of exception occurs during the exe cution of ⟨statements-1 ⟩, it will\\ncrash the program as usual.\\n(By the way , note that the braces, { and }, are part of the syntax of the try..catch\\nstatement. They are required even if there is only one statem ent between the braces. This is\\ndiﬀerent from the other statements we have seen, where the br aces around a single statement\\nare optional.)'),\n",

CONTROL\\nAs an example, suppose that str is a variable of type String whose value might or might\\nnot represent a legal real number. Then we could say:\\ntry {\\ndouble x;\\nx = Double.parseDouble(str);\\nSystem.out.println( \"The number is \" + x );\\n}\\ncatch ( NumberFormatException e ) {\\nSystem.out.println( \"Not a legal number.\" );\\n}\\nIf an error is thrown by the call to Double.parseDouble(str), then the output statement in\\nthe try part is skipped, and the statement in the catch part is executed.\\nIt’s not always a good idea to catch exceptions and continue w ith the program. Often that\\ncan just lead to an even bigger mess later on, and it might be be tter just to let the exception\\ncrash the program at the point where it occurs. However, some times it’s possible to recover\\nfrom an error. F or example, suppose that we have the enumerat ed type\\nenum Day { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY }\\nand we want the user to input a value belonging to this type. TextIO does not know about\\nthis type, so we can only read the user’s response as a string. The function Day.valueOf can\\nbe used to convert the user’s response to a value of type Day. This will throw an exception\\nof type IllegalArgumentException if the user’s response is not the name of one of the values of\\ntype Day, but we can respond to the error easily enough by asking the us er to enter another\\nresponse. Here is a code segment that does this. (Converting the user’s response to upper case\\nwill allow responses such as “Monday” or “monday” in additio n to “MONDA Y”.)\\nDay weekday; // User’s response as a value of type Day.\\nwhile ( true ) {\\nString response; // User’s response as a String.\\nTextIO.put(\"Please enter a day of the week: \");\\nresponse = TextIO.getln();\\nresponse = response.toUpperCase();\\ntry {\\nweekday = Day.valueOf(response);\\nbreak;\\n}\\ncatch ( IllegalArgumentException e ) {\\nTextIO.putln( response + \" is not the name of a day of the week.\" );\\n}\\n}\\nThe break statement will be reached only if the user’s response is acce ptable, and so the loop\\nwill end only when a legal value has been assigned to weekday.\\n3.7.3 Exceptions in T extIO\\nWhen TextIO reads a numeric value from the user, it makes sure that the use r’s response is\\nlegal, using a technique similar to the while loop and try..catch in the previous example.\\nHowever, TextIO can read data from other sources besides the user. (See Subse ction 2.4.5.)\\nWhen it is reading from a ﬁle, there is no reasonable way for TextIO to recover from an illegal\\nvalue in the input, so it responds by throwing an exception. T o keep things simple, TextIO only'),\n",

In TextIO, the exception is of type IllegalArgumentException. If\\nyou have a better response to ﬁle errors than to let the progra m crash, you can use a try..catch\\nto catch exceptions of type IllegalArgumentException.\\nF or example, suppose that a ﬁle contains nothing but real num bers, and we want a program\\nthat will read the numbers and ﬁnd their sum and their average . Since it is unknown how many\\nnumbers are in the ﬁle, there is the question of when to stop re ading. One approach is simply\\nto try to keep reading indeﬁnitely . When the end of the ﬁle is r eached, an exception occurs.\\nThis exception is not really an error—it’s just a way of detec ting the end of the data, so we\\ncan catch the exception and ﬁnish up the program. W e can read t he data in a while (true)\\nloop and break out of the loop when an exception occurs. This i s an example of the somewhat\\nunusual technique of using an exception as part of the expect ed ﬂow of control in a program.\\nT o read from the ﬁle, we need to know the ﬁle’s name. T o make the program more general,\\nwe can let the user enter the ﬁle name, instead of hard-coding a ﬁxed ﬁle name in the program.\\nHowever, it is possible that the user will enter the name of a ﬁ le that does not exist. When\\nwe use TextIO.readfile to open a ﬁle that does not exist, an exception of type IllegalArgu-\\nmentException occurs.

In the rest of the text, we’ll be m ore concerned with the larger\\nscale structure of programs, but the material that you’ve al ready learned will be an important\\nfoundation for everything to come.\\nIn this section, before moving on to programming-in-the-la rge, we’ll take a look at how\\nprogramming-in-the-small can be used in other contexts bes ides text-based, command-line-\\nstyle programs. W e’ll do this by taking a short, introductor y look at applets and graphical\\nprogramming.\\nAn applet is a Java program that runs on a W eb page. An applet is not a stan d-alone\\napplication, and it does not have a main() routine. In fact, an applet is an object rather than\\na class. When Java ﬁrst appeared on the scene, applets were one of its major appeals. Since\\nthen, they have become less important, although they can sti ll be very useful. When we study\\nGUI programming in Chapter 6, we will concentrate on stand-a lone GUI programs rather than\\non applets, but applets are a good place to start for our ﬁrst l ook at the subject.\\nWhen an applet is placed on a W eb page, it is assigned a rectang ular area on the page. It\\nis the job of the applet to draw the contents of that rectangle . When the region needs to be\\ndrawn, the W eb page calls a subroutine in the applet to do so. T his is not so diﬀerent from\\nwhat happens with stand-alone programs. When such a program needs to be run, the system\\ncalls the main() routine of the program. Similarly , when an applet needs to be drawn, the\\nW eb page calls the paint() routine of the applet. The programmer speciﬁes what happens\\nwhen these routines are called by ﬁlling in the bodies of the r outines. Programming in the'),\n",

GUI PROGRAMMING 105\\nsmall! Applets can do other things besides draw themselves, such as responding when the user\\nclicks the mouse on the applet. Each of the applet’s behavior s is deﬁned by a subroutine.\\nThe programmer speciﬁes how the applet behaves by ﬁlling in t he bodies of the appropriate\\nsubroutines.\\nA very simple applet, which does nothing but draw itself, can be deﬁned by a class that\\ncontains nothing but a paint() routine. The source code for the class would then have the\\nform:\\nimport java.awt.*;\\nimport java.applet.*;\\npublic class ⟨name-of-applet ⟩ extends Applet {\\npublic void paint(Graphics g) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\n}\\nwhere ⟨name-of-applet⟩ is an identiﬁer that names the class, and the ⟨statements⟩ are the code\\nthat actually draws the applet. This looks similar to the deﬁ nition of a stand-alone program,\\nbut there are a few things here that need to be explained, star ting with the ﬁrst two lines.\\nWhen you write a program, there are certain built-in classes that are available for you to\\nuse. These built-in classes include System and Math. If you want to use one of these classes,\\nyou don’t have to do anything special. Y ou just go ahead and us e it. But Java also has a large\\nnumber of standard classes that are there if you want them but that are not automatically\\navailable to your program. (There are just too many of them.) If you want to use these\\nclasses in your program, you have to ask for them ﬁrst. The sta ndard classes are grouped\\ninto so-called “packages.” Two of these packages are called “java.awt” and “java.applet”. The\\ndirective “import java.awt.*;” makes all the classes from t he package java.awt available for\\nuse in your program. The java.awt package contains classes r elated to graphical user interface\\nprogramming, including a class called Graphics. The Graphics class is referred to in the\\npaint() routine above. The java.applet package contains classes sp eciﬁcally related to applets,\\nincluding the class named Applet.\\nThe ﬁrst line of the class deﬁnition above says that the class “extends Applet.” Applet is\\na standard class that is deﬁned in the java.applet package. I t deﬁnes all the basic properties\\nand behaviors of applet objects. By extending the Applet class, the new class we are deﬁning\\ninherits all those properties and behaviors. W e only have to deﬁne the ways in which our class\\ndiﬀers from the basic Applet class. In our case, the only diﬀerence is that our applet will draw\\nitself diﬀerently , so we only have to deﬁne the paint() routine that does the drawing. This is\\none of the main advantages of object-oriented programming.\\n(Actually , in the future, our applets will be deﬁned to exten d JApplet rather than Applet.\\nThe JApplet class is itself an extension of Applet. The Applet class has existed since the\\noriginal version of Java, while JApplet is part of the newer “Swing” set of graphical user\\ninterface components. F or the moment, the distinction is no t important.)\\nOne more thing needs to be mentioned—and this is a point where Java’s syntax gets un-\\nfortunately confusing. Applets are objects, not classes. I nstead of being static members of a\\nclass, the subroutines that deﬁne the applet’s behavior are part of the applet object. W e say\\nthat they are “non-static” subroutines. Of course, objects are related to classes because every\\nobject is described by a class. Now here is the part that can ge t confusing: Even though a\\nnon-static subroutine is not actually part of a class (in the sense of being part of the behavior'),\n",

CONTROL\\nof the class), it is nevertheless deﬁned in a class (in the sen se that the Java code that deﬁnes\\nthe subroutine is part of the Java code that deﬁnes the class) . Many objects can be described\\nby the same class. Each object has its own non-static subrout ine. But the common deﬁnition\\nof those subroutines—the actual Java source code—is physic ally part of the class that describes\\nall the objects. T o put it brieﬂy: static subroutines in a cla ss deﬁnition say what the class does;\\nnon-static subroutines say what all the objects described b y the class do. An applet’s paint()\\nroutine is an example of a non-static subroutine. A stand-al one program’s main() routine is an\\nexample of a static subroutine. The distinction doesn’t rea lly matter too much at this point:\\nWhen working with stand-alone programs, mark everything wi th the reserved word, “ static”;\\nleave it out when working with applets. However, the distinc tion between static and non-static\\nwill become more important later in the course.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nLet’s write an applet that draws something. In order to write an applet that draws some-\\nthing, you need to know what subroutines are available for dr awing, just as in writing text-\\noriented programs you need to know what subroutines are avai lable for reading and writing\\ntext. In Java, the built-in drawing subroutines are found in objects of the class Graphics, one\\nof the classes in the java.awt package. In an applet’s paint() routine, you can use the Graphics\\nobject g for drawing. (This object is provided as a parameter to the paint() routine when\\nthat routine is called.) Graphics objects contain many subroutines. I’ll mention just three o f\\nthem here. Y ou’ll encounter more of them in Chapter 6.\\n• g.setColor(c), is called to set the color that is used for drawing. The param eter, c is\\nan object belonging to a class named Color, another one of the classes in the java.awt\\npackage. About a dozen standard colors are available as stat ic member variables in\\nthe Color class. These standard colors include Color.BLACK, Color.WHITE, Color.RED,\\nColor.GREEN, and Color.BLUE. F or example, if you want to draw in red, you would say\\n“ g.setColor(Color.RED);”. The speciﬁed color is used for all subsequent drawing oper -\\nations up until the next time setColor is called.\\n• g.drawRect(x,y,w,h) draws the outline of a rectangle. The parameters x, y, w, and h\\nmust be integer-valued expressions. This subroutine draws the outline of the rectangle\\nwhose top-left corner is x pixels from the left edge of the applet and y pixels down from\\nthe top of the applet. The width of the rectangle is w pixels, and the height is h pixels.\\n• g.fillRect(x,y,w,h) is similar to drawRect except that it ﬁlls in the inside of the rect-\\nangle instead of just drawing an outline.\\nThis is enough information to write an applet that will draw t he following image on a W eb\\npage:'),\n",

GUI PROGRAMMING 107\\nThe applet ﬁrst ﬁlls its entire rectangular area with red. Th en it changes the drawing color\\nto black and draws a sequence of rectangles, where each recta ngle is nested inside the previous\\none. The rectangles can be drawn with a while loop. Each time through the loop, the rectangle\\ngets smaller and it moves down and over a bit. W e’ll need varia bles to hold the width and height\\nof the rectangle and a variable to record how far the top-left corner of the rectangle is inset\\nfrom the edges of the applet. The while loop ends when the rect angle shrinks to nothing. In\\ngeneral outline, the algorithm for drawing the applet is\\nSet the drawing color to red (using the g.setColor subroutin e)\\nFill in the entire applet (using the g.fillRect subroutine)\\nSet the drawing color to black\\nSet the top-left corner inset to be 0\\nSet the rectangle width and height to be as big as the applet\\nwhile the width and height are greater than zero:\\ndraw a rectangle (using the g.drawRect subroutine)\\nincrease the inset\\ndecrease the width and the height\\nIn my applet, each rectangle is 15 pixels away from the rectan gle that surrounds it, so the\\ninset is increased by 15 each time through the while loop. The rectangle shrinks by 15 pixels\\non the left and by 15 pixels on the right, so the width of the rectangle shrink s by 30 each time\\nthrough the loop. The height also shrinks by 30 pixels each ti me through the loop.\\nIt is not hard to code this algorithm into Java and use it to deﬁ ne the paint() method of\\nan applet. I’ve assumed that the applet has a height of 160 pix els and a width of 300 pixels.\\nThe size is actually set in the source code of the W eb page wher e the applet appears. In order\\nfor an applet to appear on a page, the source code for the page m ust include a command that\\nspeciﬁes which applet to run and how big it should be. (W e’ll s ee how to do that later.) It’s\\nnot a great idea to assume that we know how big the applet is goi ng to be. On the other hand,\\nit’s also not a great idea to write an applet that does nothing but draw a static picture. I’ll\\naddress both these issues before the end of this section.

It’s because rectangles ar e drawn as if with a pen whose nib\\nhangs below and to the right of the point where the pen is place d. If you run the pen exactly\\nalong the right edge of the applet, the line it draws is actual ly outside the applet and therefore\\nis not seen. So instead, we run the pen along a line one pixel to the left of the edge of the\\napplet. The same reasoning applies to rectHeight. Careful graphics programming demands\\nattention to details like these.)\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nWhen you write an applet, you get to build on the work of the peo ple who wrote the Applet\\nclass.

One example that we\\nwill consider is an animated version of the nested rectangle s applet from earlier in this section.\\nY ou can see the applet in action at the bottom of the on-line ve rsion of this page.\\nA computer animation is really just a sequence of still images. The computer displ ays the\\nimages one after the other. Each image diﬀers a bit from the pr eceding image in the sequence.\\nIf the diﬀerences are not too big and if the sequence is displa yed quickly enough, the eye is\\ntricked into perceiving continuous motion.\\nIn the example, rectangles shrink continually towards the c enter of the applet, while new\\nrectangles appear at the edge. The perpetual motion is, of co urse, an illusion. If you think\\nabout it, you’ll see that the applet loops through the same se t of images over and over. In each\\nimage, there is a gap between the borders of the applet and the outermost rectangle. This gap\\ngets wider and wider until a new rectangle appears at the bord er. Only it’s not a new rectangle.\\nWhat has really happened is that the applet has started over a gain with the ﬁrst image in the\\nsequence.\\nThe problem of creating an animation is really just the probl em of drawing each of the still\\nimages that make up the animation. Each still image is called a frame. In my framework for\\nanimation, which is based on a non-standard class called SimpleAnimationApplet2, all you\\nhave to do is ﬁll in the code that says how to draw one frame. The basic format is as follows:\\nimport java.awt.*;\\npublic class ⟨name-of-class ⟩ extends SimpleAnimationApplet2 {\\npublic void drawFrame(Graphics g) {\\n⟨statements ⟩ // to draw one frame of the animation'),\n",

GUI PROGRAMMING 109\\n}\\n}\\nThe “ import java.awt.*;” is required to get access to graphics-related classes such as\\nGraphics and Color. Y ou get to ﬁll in any name you want for the class, and you get to\\nﬁll in the statements inside the subroutine. The drawFrame() subroutine will be called by the\\nsystem each time a frame needs to be drawn. All you have to do is say what happens when\\nthis subroutine is called. Of course, you have to draw a diﬀer ent picture for each frame, and to\\ndo that you need to know which frame you are drawing. The class SimpleAnimationApplet2\\nprovides a function named getFrameNumber() that you can call to ﬁnd out which frame to\\ndraw. This function returns an integer value that represent s the frame number. If the value\\nreturned is 0, you are supposed to draw the ﬁrst frame; if the v alue is 1, you are supposed to\\ndraw the second frame, and so on.\\nIn the sample applet, the thing that diﬀers from one frame to a nother is the distance between\\nthe edges of the applet and the outermost rectangle. Since th e rectangles are 15 pixels apart,\\nthis distance increases from 0 to 14 and then jumps back to 0 wh en a “new” rectangle appears.\\nThe appropriate value can be computed very simply from the fr ame number, with the statement\\n“ inset = getFrameNumber() % 15;”. The value of the expression getFrameNumber() % 15 is\\nbetween 0 and 14. When the frame number reaches 15 or any multi ple of 15, the value of\\ngetFrameNumber() % 15 jumps back to 0.\\nDrawing one frame in the sample animated applet is very simil ar to drawing the single\\nimage of the StaticRects applet, as given above. The paint() method in the StaticRects\\napplet becomes, with only minor modiﬁcation, the drawFrame() method of my MovingRects\\nanimation applet. I’ve chosen to make one improvement: The StaticRects applet assumes\\nthat the applet is 300 by 160 pixels. The MovingRects applet will work for any applet size.\\nT o implement this, the drawFrame() routine has to know how big the applet is. There are\\ntwo functions that can be called to get this information. The function getWidth() returns an\\ninteger value representing the width of the applet, and the f unction getHeight() returns the\\nheight. The width and height, together with the frame number , are used to compute the size\\nof the ﬁrst rectangle that is drawn. Here is the complete sour ce code:\\nimport java.awt.*;\\npublic class MovingRects extends SimpleAnimationApplet2 {\\npublic void drawFrame(Graphics g) {\\n// Draw one frame in the animation by filling in the background\\n// with a solid red and then drawing a set of nested black\\n// rectangles. The frame number tells how much the first\\n// rectangle is to be inset from the borders of the applet.\\nint width; // Width of the applet, in pixels.\\nint height; // Height of the applet, in pixels.\\nint inset; // Gap between borders of applet and a rectangle.\\n// The inset for the outermost rectangle goes\\n// from 0 to 14 then back to 0, and so on,\\n// as the frameNumber varies.\\nint rectWidth, rectHeight; // The size of one of the rectangl es.\\nwidth = getWidth(); // Find out the size of the drawing area.'),\n",

How many times do you have to roll a pair of dice before they com e up snake eyes? Y ou\\ncould do the experiment by rolling the dice by hand.

(Note: “Snake eyes” means that both dice show a\\nvalue of 1.) Exercise 2.2 explained how to simulate rolling a pair of dice.\\n2. Which integer between 1 and 10000 has the largest number of di visors, and how many\\ndivisors does it have? W rite a program to ﬁnd the answers and p rint out the results. It is\\npossible that several integers in this range have the same, m aximum number of divisors.\\nY our program only has to print out one of them. Subsection 3.4 .2 discussed divisors. The\\nsource code for that example is CountDivisors.java.\\nY ou might need some hints about how to ﬁnd a maximum value. The basic idea is\\nto go through all the integers, keeping track of the largest n umber of divisors that you’ve\\nseen so far . Also, keep track of the integer that had that number of divis ors.\\n3. W rite a program that will evaluate simple expressions such a s 17 + 3 and 3.14159 * 4.7.\\nThe expressions are to be typed in by the user. The input alway s consist of a number,\\nfollowed by an operator, followed by another number. The ope rators that are allowed are\\n+, -, *, and /. Y ou can read the numbers with TextIO.getDouble() and the operator\\nwith TextIO.getChar(). Y our program should read an expression, print its value, re ad\\nanother expression, print its value, and so on. The program s hould end when the user\\nenters 0 as the ﬁrst number on the line.\\n4. W rite a program that reads one line of input text and breaks it up into words. The\\nwords should be output one per line. A word is deﬁned to be a seq uence of letters. Any\\ncharacters in the input that are not letters should be discar ded.

The data is a number of type double. However, for some cities, no data was\\navailable. In these lines, the data is replaced by a comment e xplaining why the data is\\nmissing. F or example, several lines from the ﬁle might look l ike:\\nSan Francisco: 19887.32\\nChicago: no report received\\nNew York: 298734.12\\nW rite a program that will compute and print the total sales fr om all the cities together.\\nThe program should also report the number of cities for which data was not available.\\nThe name of the ﬁle is “sales.dat”.\\nT o complete this program, you’ll need one fact about ﬁle inpu t with T extIO that was\\nnot covered in Subsection 2.4.5. Since you don’t know in adva nce how many lines there\\nare in the ﬁle, you need a way to tell when you have gotten to the end of the ﬁle. When\\nT extIO is reading from a ﬁle, the function TextIO.eof() can be used to test for end of\\nﬁle . This boolean-valued function returns true if the ﬁle has been entirely read and\\nreturns false if there is more data to read in the ﬁle. This means that you can read the\\nlines of the ﬁle in a loop while (TextIO.eof() == false).... The loop will end when\\nall the lines of the ﬁle have been read.\\nSuggestion: F or each line, read and ignore characters up to t he colon.

Here is a tricky\\nway to determine whether a given square is red or black: If the row number and the\\ncolumn number are either both even or both odd, then the squar e is red. Otherwise, it is\\nblack. Note that a square is just a rectangle in which the heig ht is equal to the width, so\\nyou can use the subroutine g.fillRect() to draw the squares.

Elsewhere in the program, that name can be used a s a stand-in for the whole set\\nof instructions. As a computer executes a program, whenever it encounters a subroutine name,\\nit executes all the instructions necessary to carry out the t ask associated with that subroutine.\\nSubroutines can be used over and over, at diﬀerent places in t he program. A subroutine\\ncan even be used inside another subroutine. This allows you t o write simple subroutines and\\nthen use them to help write more complex subroutines, which c an then be used in turn in other\\nsubroutines. In this way , very complex programs can be built up step-by-step, where each step\\nin the construction is reasonably simple.\\nAs mentioned in Section 3.8, subroutines in Java can be eithe r static or non-static. This\\nchapter covers static subroutines only . Non-static subrou tines, which are used in true object-\\noriented programming, will be covered in the next chapter.\\n4.1 Black Boxes\\nA subroutine consists of instructions for performing some task, chunked together and\\ngiven a name. “Chunking” allows you to deal with a potentiall y very complicated task as\\na single concept. Instead of worrying about the many , many st eps that the computer might\\nhave to go though to perform that task, you just need to rememb er the name of the subroutine.\\nWhenever you want your program to perform the task, you just c all the subroutine. Subroutines\\nare a major tool for dealing with complexity .\\nA subroutine is sometimes said to be a “black box” because you can’t see what’s “inside”\\nit (or, to be more precise, you usually don’t want to see inside it, because then you would\\nhave to deal with all the complexity that the subroutine is me ant to hide). Of course, a black\\nbox that has no way of interacting with the rest of the world wo uld be pretty useless. A black\\nbox needs some kind of interface with the rest of the world, which allows some interaction\\nbetween what’s inside the box and what’s outside. A physical black box might have buttons\\non the outside that you can push, dials that you can set, and sl ots that can be used for passing\\ninformation back and forth. Since we are trying to hide compl exity , not create it, we have the\\nﬁrst rule of black boxes:\\n117'),\n",

SUBROUTINES\\nThe interface of a black box should be fairly straight-\\nforward, well-deﬁned, and easy to understand.\\nAre there any examples of black boxes in the real world? Y es; i n fact, you are surrounded by\\nthem. Y our television, your car, your VCR, your refrigerato r. . . . Y ou can turn your television\\non and oﬀ, change channels, and set the volume by using elemen ts of the television’s interface—\\ndials, remote control, don’t forget to plug in the power—wit hout understanding anything about\\nhow the thing actually works. The same goes for a VCR, althoug h if the stories are true about\\nhow hard people ﬁnd it to set the time on a VCR, then maybe the VC R violates the simple\\ninterface rule.\\nNow, a black box does have an inside—the code in a subroutine t hat actually performs\\nthe task, all the electronics inside your television set. Th e inside of a black box is called its\\nimplementation. The second rule of black boxes is that:\\nT o use a black box, you shouldn’t need to know any-\\nthing about its implementation; all you need to know is\\nits interface.\\nIn fact, it should be possible to change the implementation, as long as the behavior of the\\nbox, as seen from the outside, remains unchanged. F or exampl e, when the insides of TV sets\\nwent from using vacuum tubes to using transistors, the users of the sets didn’t even need to\\nknow about it—or even know what it means. Similarly , it shoul d be possible to rewrite the\\ninside of a subroutine, to use more eﬃcient code, for example , without aﬀecting the programs\\nthat use that subroutine.\\nOf course, to have a black box, someone must have designed and built the implementation\\nin the ﬁrst place. The black box idea works to the advantage of the implementor as well as\\nof the user of the black box. After all, the black box might be u sed in an unlimited number\\nof diﬀerent situations. The implementor of the black box doe sn’t need to know about any of\\nthat. The implementor just needs to make sure that the box per forms its assigned task and\\ninterfaces correctly with the rest of the world. This is the t hird rule of black boxes:\\nThe implementor of a black box should not need to\\nknow anything about the larger systems in which the box\\nwill be used.\\nIn a way , a black box divides the world into two parts: the insi de (implementation) and the\\noutside. The interface is at the boundary , connecting those two parts.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nBy the way , you should not think of an interface as just the physical connection betwee n\\nthe box and the rest of the world. The interface also includes a speciﬁcation of what the\\nbox does and how it can be controlled by using the elements of t he physical interface. It’s not\\nenough to say that a TV set has a power switch; you need to speci fy that the power switch is\\nused to turn the TV on and oﬀ!\\nT o put this in computer science terms, the interface of a subr outine has a semantic as well\\nas a syntactic component. The syntactic part of the interfac e tells you just what you have\\nto type in order to call the subroutine. The semantic compone nt speciﬁes exactly what task\\nthe subroutine will accomplish. T o write a legal program, yo u need to know the syntactic\\nspeciﬁcation of the subroutine. T o understand the purpose o f the subroutine and to use it\\neﬀectively , you need to know the subroutine’s semantic spec iﬁcation. I will refer to both parts\\nof the interface—syntactic and semantic—collectively as t he contract of the subroutine.'),\n",

(I should admit that\\nin practice, subroutines’ contracts are often inadequatel y speciﬁed, much to the regret and\\nannoyance of the programmers who have to use them.)\\nF or the rest of this chapter, I turn from general ideas about b lack boxes and subroutines\\nin general to the speciﬁcs of writing and using subroutines i n Java.

This should be especiall y clear in Section 4.6, where I will\\ndiscuss subroutines as a tool in program development.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nY ou should keep in mind that subroutines are not the only exam ple of black boxes in\\nprogramming. F or example, a class is also a black box. W e’ll s ee that a class can have a\\n“public” part, representing its interface, and a “private” part that is entirely inside its hidden\\nimplementation. All the principles of black boxes apply to c lasses as well as to subroutines.\\n4.2 Static Subroutines and Static Variables\\nEvery subroutine in Java must be deﬁned inside some class. This makes Java rather\\nunusual among programming languages, since most languages allow free-ﬂoating, independent\\nsubroutines. One purpose of a class is to group together rela ted subroutines and variables.\\nPerhaps the designers of Java felt that everything must be re lated to something. As a less\\nphilosophical motivation, Java’s designers wanted to plac e ﬁrm controls on the ways things are\\nnamed, since a Java program potentially has access to a huge n umber of subroutines created by\\nmany diﬀerent programmers. The fact that those subroutines are grouped into named classes\\n(and classes are grouped into named “packages”) helps contr ol the confusion that might result\\nfrom so many diﬀerent names.\\nA subroutine that is a member of a class is often called a method, and “method” is the\\nterm that most people prefer for subroutines in Java. I will s tart using the term “method”\\noccasionally; however, I will continue to prefer the more ge neral term “subroutine” for static\\nsubroutines. I will use the term “method” most often to refer to non-static subroutines, which\\nbelong to objects rather than to classes. This chapter will d eal with static subroutines almost\\nexclusively . W e’ll turn to non-static methods and object-o riented programming in the next\\nchapter.\\n4.2.1 Subroutine Deﬁnitions\\nA subroutine deﬁnition in Java takes the form:\\n⟨modifiers ⟩ ⟨ return-type ⟩ ⟨ subroutine-name ⟩ ( ⟨parameter-list ⟩ ) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nIt will take us a while—most of the chapter—to get through wha t all this means in detail. Of\\ncourse, you’ve already seen examples of subroutines in prev ious chapters, such as the main()\\nroutine of a program and the paint() routine of an applet. So you are familiar with the general\\nformat.\\nThe ⟨statements⟩ between the braces, { and }, in a subroutine deﬁnition make up the body\\nof the subroutine. These statements are the inside, or imple mentation part, of the “black box”,'),\n",

SUBROUTINES\\nas discussed in the previous section. They are the instructi ons that the computer executes when\\nthe method is called. Subroutines can contain any of the stat ements discussed in Chapter 2\\nand Chapter 3.\\nThe ⟨modiﬁers ⟩ that can occur at the beginning of a subroutine deﬁnition are words that\\nset certain characteristics of the subroutine, such as whet her it is static or not. The modiﬁers\\nthat you’ve seen so far are “ static” and “ public”. There are only about a half-dozen possible\\nmodiﬁers altogether.\\nIf the subroutine is a function, whose job is to compute some v alue, then the ⟨return-type⟩is\\nused to specify the type of value that is returned by the funct ion. W e’ll be looking at functions\\nand return types in some detail in Section 4.4. If the subrout ine is not a function, then the\\n⟨return-type⟩ is replaced by the special value void, which indicates that no value is returned.\\nThe term “void” is meant to indicate that the return value is e mpty or non-existent.\\nFinally , we come to the ⟨parameter-list⟩ of the method. Parameters are part of the interface\\nof a subroutine. They represent information that is passed i nto the subroutine from outside,\\nto be used by the subroutine’s internal computations. F or a c oncrete example, imagine a class\\nnamed T elevision that includes a method named changeChannel(). The immediate question\\nis: What channel should it change to? A parameter can be used t o answer this question. Since\\nthe channel number is an integer, the type of the parameter wo uld be int, and the declaration\\nof the changeChannel() method might look like\\npublic void changeChannel(int channelNum) { ... }\\nThis declaration speciﬁes that changeChannel() has a parameter named channelNum of type\\nint. However, channelNum does not yet have any particular value. A value for channelNum is\\nprovided when the subroutine is called; for example: changeChannel(17);\\nThe parameter list in a subroutine can be empty , or it can cons ist of one or more parameter\\ndeclarations of the form ⟨type⟩ ⟨parameter-name⟩. If there are several declarations, they are\\nseparated by commas. Note that each declaration can name onl y one parameter. F or example,\\nif you want two parameters of type double, you have to say “ double x, double y”, rather\\nthan “ double x, y”.\\nParameters are covered in more detail in the next section.\\nHere are a few examples of subroutine deﬁnitions, leaving ou t the statements that deﬁne\\nwhat the subroutines do:\\npublic static void playGame() {\\n// \"public\" and \"static\" are modifiers; \"void\" is the\\n// return-type; \"playGame\" is the subroutine-name;\\n// the parameter-list is empty.\\n. . . // Statements that define what playGame does go here.\\n}\\nint getNextN(int N) {\\n// There are no modifiers; \"int\" in the return-type\\n// \"getNextN\" is the subroutine-name; the parameter-list\\n// includes one parameter whose name is \"N\" and whose\\n// type is \"int\".\\n. . . // Statements that define what getNextN does go here.\\n}\\nstatic boolean lessThan(double x, double y) {\\n// \"static\" is a modifier; \"boolean\" is the\\n// return-type; \"lessThan\" is the subroutine-name; the'),\n",

The other modiﬁer shown in the examples is “ public”. This modiﬁer indicates\\nthat the method can be called from anywhere in a program, even from outside the class where\\nthe method is deﬁned. There is another modiﬁer, “ private”, which indicates that the method\\ncan be called only from inside the same class. The modiﬁers public and private are called\\naccess speciﬁers . If no access speciﬁer is given for a method, then by default, that method\\ncan be called from anywhere in the “package” that contains th e class, but not from outside\\nthat package. (Packages were introduced in Subsection 2.6. 4, and you’ll learn more about them\\nlater in this chapter, in Section 4.5.) There is one other acc ess modiﬁer, protected, which will\\nonly become relevant when we turn to object-oriented progra mming in Chapter 5.\\nNote, by the way , that the main() routine of a program follows the usual syntax rules for\\na subroutine. In\\npublic static void main(String[] args) { ... }\\nthe modiﬁers are public and static, the return type is void, the subroutine name is main, and\\nthe parameter list is “ String[] args”. The only question might be about “ String[]”, which\\nhas to be a type if it is to match the syntax of a parameter list. In fact, String[] represents\\na so-called “array type”, so the syntax is valid. W e will cove r arrays in Chapter 7. (The\\nparameter, args, represents information provided to the program when the main() routine is\\ncalled by the system. In case you know the term, the informati on consists of any “command-line\\narguments” speciﬁed in the command that the user typed to run the program.)\\nY ou’ve already had some experience with ﬁlling in the implem entation of a subroutine. In\\nthis chapter, you’ll learn all about writing your own comple te subroutine deﬁnitions, including\\nthe interface part.\\n4.2.2 Calling Subroutines\\nWhen you deﬁne a subroutine, all you are doing is telling the c omputer that the subroutine\\nexists and what it does. The subroutine doesn’t actually get executed until it is called. (This\\nis true even for the main() routine in a class—even though you don’t call it, it is called by the\\nsystem when the system runs your program.) F or example, the playGame() method given as\\nan example above could be called using the following subrout ine call statement:\\nplayGame();\\nThis statement could occur anywhere in the same class that in cludes the deﬁnition of\\nplayGame(), whether in a main() method or in some other subroutine. Since playGame()\\nis a public method, it can also be called from other classes, but in that c ase, you have to tell\\nthe computer which class it comes from. Since playGame() is a static method, its full name\\nincludes the name of the class in which it is deﬁned. Let’s say , for example, that playGame() is\\ndeﬁned in a class named Poker. Then to call playGame() from outside the Poker class, you\\nwould have to say\\nPoker.playGame();'),\n",

SUBROUTINES\\nThe use of the class name here tells the computer which class t o look in to ﬁnd the method. It\\nalso lets you distinguish between Poker.playGame() and other potential playGame() methods\\ndeﬁned in other classes, such as Roulette.playGame() or Blackjack.playGame().\\nMore generally , a subroutine call statement for a static subroutine takes the form\\n⟨subroutine-name ⟩(⟨parameters ⟩);\\nif the subroutine that is being called is in the same class, or\\n⟨class-name ⟩.⟨subroutine-name ⟩(⟨parameters ⟩);\\nif the subroutine is deﬁned elsewhere, in a diﬀerent class. ( Non-static methods belong to objects\\nrather than classes, and they are called using object names i nstead of class names. More on\\nthat later.) Note that the parameter list can be empty , as in t he playGame() example, but the\\nparentheses must be there even if there is nothing between th em.\\n4.2.3 Subroutines in Programs\\nIt’s time to give an example of what a complete program looks l ike, when it includes other\\nsubroutines in addition to the main() routine. Let’s write a program that plays a guessing\\ngame with the user. The computer will choose a random number b etween 1 and 100, and the\\nuser will try to guess it. The computer tells the user whether the guess is high or low or correct.\\nIf the user gets the number after six guesses or fewer, the use r wins the game. After each game,\\nthe user has the option of continuing with another game.\\nSince playing one game can be thought of as a single, coherent task, it makes sense to write\\na subroutine that will play one guessing game with the user. T he main() routine will use a\\nloop to call the playGame() subroutine over and over, as many times as the user wants to pl ay .\\nW e approach the problem of designing the playGame() subroutine the same way we write a\\nmain() routine: Start with an outline of the algorithm and apply ste pwise reﬁnement. Here is\\na short pseudocode algorithm for a guessing game program:\\nPick a random number\\nwhile the game is not over:\\nGet the user’s guess\\nTell the user whether the guess is high, low, or correct.\\nThe test for whether the game is over is complicated, since th e game ends if either the user\\nmakes a correct guess or the number of guesses is six. As in man y cases, the easiest thing to\\ndo is to use a “ while (true)” loop and use break to end the loop whenever we ﬁnd a reason\\nto do so. Also, if we are going to end the game after six guesses , we’ll have to keep track of the\\nnumber of guesses that the user has made. Filling out the algo rithm gives:\\nLet computersNumber be a random number between 1 and 100\\nLet guessCount = 0\\nwhile (true):\\nGet the user’s guess\\nCount the guess by adding 1 to guess count\\nif the user’s guess equals computersNumber:\\nTell the user he won\\nbreak out of the loop\\nif the number of guesses is 6:\\nTell the user he lost\\nbreak out of the loop\\nif the user’s guess is less than computersNumber:'),\n",

ST A TIC SUBROUTINES AND V ARIABLES 125\\ndistinguish such variables from local variables, we call th em member variables , since they\\nare members of a class.\\nJust as with subroutines, member variables can be either sta tic or non-static. In this\\nchapter, we’ll stick to static variables. A static member va riable belongs to the class itself, and\\nit exists as long as the class exists. Memory is allocated for the variable when the class is ﬁrst\\nloaded by the Java interpreter. Any assignment statement th at assigns a value to the variable\\nchanges the content of that memory , no matter where that assi gnment statement is located in\\nthe program. Any time the variable is used in an expression, t he value is fetched from that\\nsame memory , no matter where the expression is located in the program. This means that the\\nvalue of a static member variable can be set in one subroutine and used in another subroutine.\\nStatic member variables are “shared” by all the static subro utines in the class. A local variable\\nin a subroutine, on the other hand, exists only while that sub routine is being executed, and is\\ncompletely inaccessible from outside that one subroutine.\\nThe declaration of a member variable looks just like the decl aration of a local variable\\nexcept for two things: The member variable is declared outsi de any subroutine (although it\\nstill has to be inside a class), and the declaration can be mar ked with modiﬁers such as static,\\npublic, and private. Since we are only working with static member variables for n ow, every\\ndeclaration of a member variable in this chapter will includ e the modiﬁer static. They might\\nalso be marked as public or private. F or example:\\nstatic String usersName;\\npublic static int numberOfPlayers;\\nprivate static double velocity, time;\\nA static member variable that is not declared to be private can be accessed from outside\\nthe class where it is deﬁned, as well as inside. When it is used in some other class, it must be\\nreferred to with a compound identiﬁer of the form ⟨class-name⟩.⟨variable-name⟩. F or example,\\nthe System class contains the public static member variable named out, and you use this\\nvariable in your own classes by referring to System.out. If numberOfPlayers is a public\\nstatic member variable in a class named Poker, then subroutines in the Poker class would\\nrefer to it simply as numberOfPlayers, while subroutines in another class would refer to it as\\nPoker.numberOfPlayers.\\nAs an example, let’s add a static member variable to the GuessingGame class that we wrote\\nearlier in this section. This variable will be used to keep tr ack of how many games the user wins.\\nW e’ll call the variable gamesWon and declare it with the statement “ static int gamesWon;”.\\nIn the playGame() routine, we add 1 to gamesWon if the user wins the game. At the end of the\\nmain() routine, we print out the value of gamesWon. It would be impossible to do the same\\nthing with a local variable, since we need access to the same v ariable from both subroutines.\\nWhen you declare a local variable in a subroutine, you have to assign a value to that variable\\nbefore you can do anything with it. Member variables, on the o ther hand are automatically\\ninitialized with a default value. F or numeric variables, th e default value is zero. F or boolean\\nvariables, the default is false. And for char variables, it’s the unprintable character that has\\nUnicode code number zero. (F or objects, such as Strings, the default initial value is a special\\nvalue called null, which we won’t encounter oﬃcially until later.)\\nSince it is of type int, the static member variable gamesWon automatically gets assigned an\\ninitial value of zero. This happens to be the correct initial value for a variable that is being\\nused as a counter. Y ou can, of course, assign a diﬀerent value to the variable at the beginning\\nof the main() routine if you are not satisﬁed with the default initial valu e.'),\n",

Parameters are pa rt of the interface of a subroutine.\\nThey allow you to customize the behavior of a subroutine to ad apt it to a particular situation.\\nAs an analogy , consider a thermostat—a black box whose task i t is to keep your house\\nat a certain temperature. The thermostat has a parameter, na mely the dial that is used to\\nset the desired temperature. The thermostat always perform s the same task: maintaining a\\nconstant temperature. However, the exact task that it perfo rms—that is, which temperature\\nit maintains—is customized by the setting on its dial.\\n4.3.1 Using Parameters\\nAs an example, let’s go back to the “3N+1” problem that was dis cussed in Subsection 3.2.2.\\n(Recall that a 3N+1 sequence is computed according to the rul e, “if N is odd, multiply by 3\\nand add 1; if N is even, divide by 2; continue until N is equal to 1.” F or example, starting from\\nN=3 we get the sequence: 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.) Suppose that w e want to write a subroutine\\nto print out such sequences. The subroutine will always perf orm the same task: Print out a\\n3N+1 sequence. But the exact sequence it prints out depends o n the starting value of N. So, the\\nstarting value of N would be a parameter to the subroutine. Th e subroutine could be written\\nlike this:\\n/**\\n* This subroutine prints a 3N+1 sequence to standard output, using\\n* startingValue as the initial value of N.

Within the body of the subroutine, the parameter name can\\nbe used in the same way as a variable name. However, the parame ter gets its initial value\\nfrom outside the subroutine. When the subroutine is called, a value must b e provided for\\nthis parameter in the subroutine call statement. This value will be assigned to the parameter,\\nstartingValue, before the body of the subroutine is executed. F or example, the subrou-\\ntine could be called using the subroutine call statement “ print3NSequence(17);”. When the\\ncomputer executes this statement, the computer assigns the value 17 to startingValue and\\nthen executes the statements in the subroutine. This prints the 3N+1 sequence starting from\\n17. If K is a variable of type int, then when the computer executes the subroutine call state-\\nment “ print3NSequence(K);”, it will take the value of the variable K, assign that value to\\nstartingValue, and execute the body of the subroutine.\\nThe class that contains print3NSequence can contain a main() routine (or other subrou-\\ntines) that call print3NSequence. F or example, here is a main() program that prints out 3N+1\\nsequences for various starting values speciﬁed by the user:\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nTextIO.putln(\"This program will print out 3N+1 sequences\");\\nTextIO.putln(\"for starting values that you specify.\");\\nTextIO.putln();\\nint K; // Input from user; loop ends when K < 0.\\ndo {\\nTextIO.putln(\"Enter a starting value;\")\\nTextIO.put(\"To end the program, enter 0: \");\\nK = TextIO.getInt(); // Get starting value from user.\\nif (K > 0) // Print sequence, but only if K is > 0.\\nprint3NSequence(K);\\n} while (K > 0); // Continue only if K > 0.\\n} // end main\\nRemember that before you can use this program, the deﬁnition s of main and of\\nprint3NSequence must both be wrapped inside a class deﬁnition.\\n4.3.2 F ormal and Actual Parameters\\nNote that the term “parameter” is used to refer to two diﬀeren t, but related, concepts. There\\nare parameters that are used in the deﬁnitions of subroutine s, such as startingValue in the\\nabove example. And there are parameters that are used in subr outine call statements, such\\nas the K in the statement “ print3NSequence(K);”. Parameters in a subroutine deﬁnition are\\ncalled formal parameters or dummy parameters . The parameters that are passed to a\\nsubroutine when it is called are called actual parameters or arguments. When a subroutine\\nis called, the actual parameters in the subroutine call stat ement are evaluated and the values\\nare assigned to the formal parameters in the subroutine’s de ﬁnition. Then the body of the\\nsubroutine is executed.'),\n",

P ARAMETERS 129\\nA formal parameter must be a name, that is, a simple identiﬁer. A formal parameter is\\nvery much like a variable, and—like a variable—it has a speci ﬁed type such as int, boolean, or\\nString. An actual parameter is a value, and so it can be speciﬁed by any expression, provided\\nthat the expression computes a value of the correct type. The type of the actual parameter must\\nbe one that could legally be assigned to the formal parameter with an assignment statement.\\nF or example, if the formal parameter is of type double, then it would be legal to pass an int as\\nthe actual parameter since ints can legally be assigned to doubles. When you call a subroutine,\\nyou must provide one actual parameter for each formal parame ter in the subroutine’s deﬁnition.\\nConsider, for example, a subroutine\\nstatic void doTask(int N, double x, boolean test) {\\n// statements to perform the task go here\\n}\\nThis subroutine might be called with the statement\\ndoTask(17, Math.sqrt(z+1), z >= 10);\\nWhen the computer executes this statement, it has essential ly the same eﬀect as the block of\\nstatements:\\n{\\nint N; // Allocate memory locations for the formal parameter s.\\ndouble x;\\nboolean test;\\nN = 17; // Assign 17 to the first formal parameter, N.\\nx = Math.sqrt(z+1); // Compute Math.sqrt(z+1), and assign i t to\\n// the second formal parameter, x.\\ntest = (z >= 10); // Evaluate \"z >= 10\" and assign the resulting\\n// true/false value to the third formal\\n// parameter, test.\\n// statements to perform the task go here\\n}\\n(There are a few technical diﬀerences between this and “ doTask(17,Math.sqrt(z+1),z>=10);”\\n—besides the amount of typing—because of questions about sc ope of variables and what hap-\\npens when several variables or parameters have the same name .)\\nBeginning programming students often ﬁnd parameters to be s urprisingly confusing. Call-\\ning a subroutine that already exists is not a problem—the ide a of providing information to the\\nsubroutine in a parameter is clear enough. W riting the subro utine deﬁnition is another matter.\\nA common mistake is to assign values to the formal parameters at the beginning of the subrou-\\ntine, or to ask the user to input their values. This represent s a fundamental misunderstanding.\\nWhen the statements in the subroutine are executed, the form al parameters will already have\\nvalues. The values come from the subroutine call statement. Remember that a subroutine is\\nnot independent. It is called by some other routine, and it is the calling routine’s responsibility\\nto provide appropriate values for the parameters.\\n4.3.3 Overloading\\nIn order to call a subroutine legally , you need to know its nam e, you need to know how many\\nformal parameters it has, and you need to know the type of each parameter. This information is\\ncalled the subroutine’s signature. The signature of the subroutine doTask, used as an example\\nabove, can be expressed as as: doTask(int,double,boolean). Note that the signature does'),\n",

SUBROUTINES\\nnot include the names of the parameters; in fact, if you just want to use the subroutine, you\\ndon’t even need to know what the formal parameter names are, s o the names are not part of\\nthe interface.\\nJava is somewhat unusual in that it allows two diﬀerent subro utines in the same class to\\nhave the same name, provided that their signatures are diﬀer ent. (The language C++ on\\nwhich Java is based also has this feature.) When this happens , we say that the name of the\\nsubroutine is overloaded because it has several diﬀerent meanings. The computer does n’t get\\nthe subroutines mixed up. It can tell which one you want to cal l by the number and types of\\nthe actual parameters that you provide in the subroutine cal l statement. Y ou have already seen\\noverloading used in the T extIO class. This class includes many diﬀerent methods named putln,\\nfor example. These methods all have diﬀerent signatures, su ch as:\\nputln(int) putln(double)\\nputln(String) putln(char)\\nputln(boolean) putln()\\nThe computer knows which of these subroutines you want to use based on the type\\nof the actual parameter that you provide. TextIO.putln(17) calls the subroutine with\\nsignature putln(int), while TextIO.putln(\"Hello\") calls the subroutine with signature\\nputln(String). Of course all these diﬀerent subroutines are semantically related, which is\\nwhy it is acceptable programming style to use the same name fo r them all. But as far as the\\ncomputer is concerned, printing out an int is very diﬀerent from printing out a String, which is\\ndiﬀerent from printing out a boolean, and so forth—so that each of these operations requires\\na diﬀerent method.\\nNote, by the way , that the signature does not include the subroutine’s return type. It is\\nillegal to have two subroutines in the same class that have th e same signature but that have\\ndiﬀerent return types. F or example, it would be a syntax erro r for a class to contain two\\nmethods deﬁned as:\\nint getln() { ... }\\ndouble getln() { ... }\\nSo it should be no surprise that in the T extIO class, the methods for reading diﬀerent types\\nare not all named getln(). In a given class, there can only be one routine that has the na me\\ngetln and has no parameters. So, the input routines in T extIO are distinguished by having\\ndiﬀerent names, such as getlnInt() and getlnDouble().\\nJava 5.0 introduced another complication: It is possible to have a single subroutine that\\ntakes a variable number of actual parameters. Y ou have alrea dy used subroutines that do\\nthis—the formatted output routines System.out.printf and TextIO.putf. When you call\\nthese subroutines, the number of parameters in the subrouti ne call can be arbitrarily large, so\\nit would be impossible to have diﬀerent subroutines to handl e each case. Unfortunately , writing\\nthe deﬁnition of such a subroutine requires some knowledge o f arrays, which will not be covered\\nuntil Chapter 7. When we get to that chapter, you’ll learn how to write subroutines with a\\nvariable number of parameters. F or now, we will ignore this c omplication.\\n4.3.4 Subroutine Examples\\nLet’s do a few examples of writing small subroutines to perfo rm assigned tasks. Of course,\\nthis is only one side of programming with subroutines. The ta sk performed by a subroutine is\\nalways a subtask in a larger program.

P ARAMETERS 131\\nbreak them up into subtasks—is the other side of programming with subroutines. W e’ll return\\nto the question of program design in Section 4.6.\\nAs a ﬁrst example, let’s write a subroutine to compute and pri nt out all the divisors of a\\ngiven positive integer. The integer will be a parameter to th e subroutine. Remember that the\\nsyntax of any subroutine is:\\n⟨modifiers ⟩ ⟨ return-type ⟩ ⟨ subroutine-name ⟩ ( ⟨parameter-list ⟩ ) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nW riting a subroutine always means ﬁlling out this format. In this case, the statement of the\\nproblem tells us that there is one parameter, of type int, and it tells us what the statements\\nin the body of the subroutine should do. Since we are only work ing with static subroutines\\nfor now, we’ll need to use static as a modiﬁer. W e could add an access modiﬁer ( public or\\nprivate), but in the absence of any instructions, I’ll leave it out. S ince we are not told to\\nreturn a value, the return type is void. Since no names are speciﬁed, we’ll have to make up\\nnames for the formal parameter and for the subroutine itself . I’ll use N for the parameter and\\nprintDivisors for the subroutine name. The subroutine will look like\\nstatic void printDivisors( int N ) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nand all we have left to do is to write the statements that make u p the body of the routine. This\\nis not diﬃcult. Just remember that you have to write the body a ssuming that N already has\\na value! The algorithm is: “F or each possible divisor D in the range from 1 to N, if D evenly\\ndivides N, then print D.” W ritten in Java, this becomes:\\n/**\\n* Print all the divisors of N.\\n* We assume that N is a positive integer.\\n*/\\nstatic void printDivisors( int N ) {\\nint D; // One of the possible divisors of N.\\nSystem.out.println(\"The divisors of \" + N + \" are:\");\\nfor ( D = 1; D <= N; D++ ) {\\nif ( N % D == 0 )\\nSystem.out.println(D);\\n}\\n}\\nI’ve added a comment before the subroutine deﬁnition indica ting the contract of the\\nsubroutine—that is, what it does and what assumptions it mak es. The contract includes the\\nassumption that N is a positive integer. It is up to the caller of the subroutine to make sure\\nthat this assumption is satisﬁed.\\nAs a second short example, consider the problem: W rite a subr outine named printRow. It\\nshould have a parameter ch of type char and a parameter N of type int. The subroutine should\\nprint out a line of text containing N copies of the character ch.\\nHere, we are told the name of the subroutine and the names of th e two parameters, so we\\ndon’t have much choice about the ﬁrst line of the subroutine d eﬁnition. The task in this case is\\npretty simple, so the body of the subroutine is easy to write. The complete subroutine is given\\nby'),\n",

SUBROUTINES\\n/**\\n* Write one line of output containing N copies of the\\n* character ch. If N <= 0, an empty line is output.\\n*/\\nstatic void printRow( char ch, int N ) {\\nint i; // Loop-control variable for counting off the copies.\\nfor ( i = 1; i <= N; i++ ) {\\nSystem.out.print( ch );\\n}\\nSystem.out.println();\\n}\\nNote that in this case, the contract makes no assumption abou t N, but it makes it clear what\\nwill happen in all cases, including the unexpected case that N < 0.\\nFinally , let’s do an example that shows how one subroutine ca n build on another. Let’s\\nwrite a subroutine that takes a String as a parameter. F or each character in the string, it will\\nprint a line of output containing 25 copies of that character . It should use the printRow()\\nsubroutine to produce the output.\\nAgain, we get to choose a name for the subroutine and a name for the parameter. I’ll call\\nthe subroutine printRowsFromString and the parameter str. The algorithm is pretty clear:\\nF or each position i in the string str, call printRow(str.charAt(i),25) to print one line of\\nthe output. So, we get:\\n/**\\n* For each character in str, write a line of output\\n* containing 25 copies of that character.\\n*/\\nstatic void printRowsFromString( String str ) {\\nint i; // Loop-control variable for counting off the chars.\\nfor ( i = 0; i < str.length(); i++ ) {\\nprintRow( str.charAt(i), 25 );\\n}\\n}\\nW e could use printRowsFromString in a main() routine such as\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nString inputLine; // Line of text input by user.\\nTextIO.put(\"Enter a line of text: \");\\ninputLine = TextIO.getln();\\nTextIO.putln();\\nprintRowsFromString( inputLine );\\n}\\nOf course, the three routines, main(), printRowsFromString(), and printRow(), would\\nhave to be collected together inside the same class. The prog ram is rather useless, but it does\\ndemonstrate the use of subroutines. Y ou’ll ﬁnd the program i n the ﬁle RowsOfChars.java, if\\nyou want to take a look.\\n4.3.5 Throwing Exceptions\\nI have been talking about the “contract” of a subroutine. The contract says what the subroutine\\nwill do, provided that the caller of the subroutine provides acceptable values for subroutine’s'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'AFPL Ghostscript 8.51', 'creator': 'dvips(k) 5.95b Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software', 'creationdate': 'D:20071115202101', 'moddate': 'D:20071115202101', 'title': 'javanotes.dvi', 'source': '../data/rag_data/javanotes5.pdf', 'total_pages': 699, 'page': 148, 'page_label': '149', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='4.3. P ARAMETERS 133\\nparameters. The question arises, though, what should the su broutine do when the caller violates\\nthe contract by providing bad parameter values?\\nW e’ve already seen that some subroutines respond to bad para meter values by throw-\\ning exceptions. (See Section 3.7.) F or example, the contrac t of the built-in subroutine\\nDouble.parseDouble says that the parameter should be a string representation of a num-\\nber of type double; if this is true, then the subroutine will convert the string into the equivalent\\nnumeric value. If the caller violates the contract by passin g an invalid string as the actual\\nparameter, the subroutine responds by throwing an exceptio n of type NumberFormatException.\\nMany subroutines throw IllegalArgumentExceptions in response to bad parameter values.\\nY ou might want to take this response in your own subroutines. This can be done with a throw\\nstatement. An exception is an object, and in order to throw an exception , you must create\\nan exception object. Y ou won’t oﬃcially learn how to do this u ntil Chapter 5, but for now, you\\ncan use the following syntax for a throw statement that throws an IllegalArgumentException:\\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException( ⟨error-message ⟩ );\\nwhere ⟨error-message⟩ is a string that describes the error that has been detected. ( The word\\n“new” in this statement is what creates the object.) T o use th is statement in a subroutine,\\nyou would check whether the values of the parameters are lega l. If not, you would throw the\\nexception. F or example, consider the print3NSequence subroutine from the beginning of this\\nsection. The parameter of print3NSequence is supposed to be a positive integer. W e can\\nmodify the subroutine deﬁnition to make it throw an exceptio n when this condition is violated:\\nstatic void print3NSequence(int startingValue) {\\nif (startingValue <= 0) // The contract is violated!\\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException( \"Starting value must be positive.\" );\\n.\\n. // (The rest of the subroutine is the same as before.)\\n.\\nIf the start value is bad, the computer executes the throw statement. This will immediate\\nterminate the subroutine, without executing the rest of the body of the subroutine. F urther-\\nmore, the program as a whole will crash unless the exception i s “caught” and handled elsewhere\\nin the program by a try..catch statement, as discussed in Section 3.7.\\n4.3.6 Global and Local Variables\\nI’ll ﬁnish this section on parameters by noting that we now ha ve three diﬀerent sorts of vari-\\nables that can be used inside a subroutine: local variables d eclared in the subroutine, formal\\nparameter names, and static member variables that are decla red outside the subroutine but\\ninside the same class as the subroutine.\\nLocal variables have no connection to the outside world; the y are purely part of the internal\\nworking of the subroutine. Parameters are used to “drop” val ues into the subroutine when it\\nis called, but once the subroutine starts executing, parame ters act much like local variables.\\nChanges made inside a subroutine to a formal parameter have n o eﬀect on the rest of the\\nprogram (at least if the type of the parameter is one of the pri mitive types—things are more\\ncomplicated in the case of objects, as we’ll see later).\\nThings are diﬀerent when a subroutine uses a variable that is deﬁned outside the subroutine.\\nThat variable exists independently of the subroutine, and i t is accessible to other parts of the\\nprogram, as well as to the subroutine. Such a variable is said to be global to the subroutine,'),\n",

SUBROUTINES\\nas opposed to the local variables deﬁned inside the subrouti ne. The scope of a global variable\\nincludes the entire class in which it is deﬁned. Changes made to a global variable can have eﬀects\\nthat extend outside the subroutine where the changes are mad e. Y ou’ve seen how this works\\nin the last example in the previous section, where the value o f the global variable, gamesWon,\\nis computed inside a subroutine and is used in the main() routine.\\nIt’s not always bad to use global variables in subroutines, b ut you should realize that the\\nglobal variable then has to be considered part of the subrout ine’s interface. The subroutine\\nuses the global variable to communicate with the rest of the p rogram. This is a kind of sneaky ,\\nback-door communication that is less visible than communic ation done through parameters,\\nand it risks violating the rule that the interface of a black b ox should be straightforward and\\neasy to understand. So before you use a global variable in a su broutine, you should consider\\nwhether it’s really necessary .\\nI don’t advise you to take an absolute stand against using glo bal variables inside subroutines.\\nThere is at least one good reason to do it: If you think of the cl ass as a whole as being a kind\\nof black box, it can be very reasonable to let the subroutines inside that box be a little sneaky\\nabout communicating with each other, if that will make the cl ass as a whole look simpler from\\nthe outside.\\n4.4 Return Values\\nA subroutine that returns a value is called a function. A given function can only\\nreturn a value of a speciﬁed type, called the return type of the function. A function call\\ngenerally occurs in a position where the computer is expecti ng to ﬁnd a value, such as the right\\nside of an assignment statement, as an actual parameter in a s ubroutine call, or in the middle\\nof some larger expression. A boolean-valued function can ev en be used as the test condition in\\nan if, while, for or do..while statement.\\n(It is also legal to use a function call as a stand-alone state ment, just as if it were a reg-\\nular subroutine. In this case, the computer ignores the valu e computed by the subroutine.\\nSometimes this makes sense. F or example, the function TextIO.getln(), with a return type\\nof String, reads and returns a line of input typed in by the user. Usuall y , the line that is\\nreturned is assigned to a variable to be used later in the prog ram, as in the statement “ name\\n= TextIO.getln();”. However, this function is also useful as a subroutine call statement\\n“ TextIO.getln();”, which still reads all input up to and including the next car riage return.\\nSince the return value is not assigned to a variable or used in an expression, it is simply dis-\\ncarded. So, the eﬀect of the subroutine call is to read and discard some input. Sometimes,\\ndiscarding unwanted input is exactly what you need to do.)\\n4.4.1 The return statement\\nY ou’ve already seen how functions such as Math.sqrt() and TextIO.getInt() can be used.\\nWhat you haven’t seen is how to write functions of your own. A f unction takes the same form\\nas a regular subroutine, except that you have to specify the v alue that is to be returned by the\\nsubroutine. This is done with a return statement , which has the following syntax:\\nreturn ⟨expression ⟩ ;\\nSuch a return statement can only occur inside the deﬁnition of a function, and the type\\nof the ⟨expression⟩ must match the return type that was speciﬁed for the function . (More\\nexactly , it must be legal to assign the expression to a variab le whose type is speciﬁed by the'),\n",

RETURN V ALUES 135\\nreturn type.) When the computer executes this return statement, it evaluates the expression,\\nterminates execution of the function, and uses the value of t he expression as the returned value\\nof the function.\\nF or example, consider the function deﬁnition\\nstatic double pythagoras(double x, double y) {\\n// Computes the length of the hypotenuse of a right\\n// triangle, where the sides of the triangle are x and y.\\nreturn Math.sqrt( x*x + y*y );\\n}\\nSuppose the computer executes the statement “ totalLength = 17 + pythagoras(12,5);”.\\nWhen it gets to the term pythagoras(12,5), it assigns the actual parameters 12 and 5 to\\nthe formal parameters x and y in the function. In the body of the function, it evaluates\\nMath.sqrt(12.0*12.0 + 5.0*5.0), which works out to 13.0. This value is “returned” by the\\nfunction, so the 13.0 essentially replaces the function call in the statement “ totalLength =\\n17 + pythagoras(12,5);”. The return value is added to 17, and the result, 30.0, is stored in\\nthe variable, totalLength. The eﬀect is the same as if the statement had been “ totalLength\\n= 17 + 13.0;”.\\nNote that a return statement does not have to be the last statement in the functi on\\ndeﬁnition. At any point in the function where you know the val ue that you want to return, you\\ncan return it. Returning a value will end the function immedi ately , skipping any subsequent\\nstatements in the function. However, it must be the case that the function deﬁnitely does return\\nsome value, no matter what path the execution of the function takes through the code.\\nY ou can use a return statement inside an ordinary subroutine, one with declared return\\ntype “ void”. Since a void subroutine does not return a value, the return statement does not\\ninclude an expression; it simply takes the form “ return;”. The eﬀect of this statement is to\\nterminate execution of the subroutine and return control ba ck to the point in the program from\\nwhich the subroutine was called. This can be convenient if yo u want to terminate execution\\nsomewhere in the middle of the subroutine, but return statements are optional in non-function\\nsubroutines. In a function, on the other hand, a return state ment, with expression, is always\\nrequired.\\n4.4.2 F unction Examples\\nHere is a very simple function that could be used in a program t o compute 3N+1 sequences.\\n(The 3N+1 sequence problem is one we’ve looked at several tim es already , including in the\\nprevious section). Given one term in a 3N+1 sequence, this fu nction computes the next term\\nof the sequence:\\nstatic int nextN(int currentN) {\\nif (currentN % 2 == 1) // test if current N is odd\\nreturn 3*currentN + 1; // if so, return this value\\nelse\\nreturn currentN / 2; // if not, return this instead\\n}\\nThis function has two return statements.

SUBROUTINES\\n4.5 APIs, Packages, and Javadoc\\nAs computers and their user interfaces have become easier to use, they have also\\nbecome more complex for programmers to deal with. Y ou can wri te programs for a simple\\nconsole-style user interface using just a few subroutines t hat write output to the console and\\nread the user’s typed replies. A modern graphical user inter face, with windows, buttons, scroll\\nbars, menus, text-input boxes, and so on, might make things e asier for the user, but it forces\\nthe programmer to cope with a hugely expanded array of possib ilities. The programmer sees\\nthis increased complexity in the form of great numbers of sub routines that are provided for\\nmanaging the user interface, as well as for other purposes.\\n4.5.1 T oolboxes\\nSomeone who wants to program for Macintosh computers—and to produce programs that look\\nand behave the way users expect them to—must deal with the Mac intosh T oolbox, a collection of\\nwell over a thousand diﬀerent subroutines. There are routin es for opening and closing windows,\\nfor drawing geometric ﬁgures and text to windows, for adding buttons to windows, and for\\nresponding to mouse clicks on the window. There are other rou tines for creating menus and\\nfor reacting to user selections from menus. Aside from the us er interface, there are routines\\nfor opening ﬁles and reading data from them, for communicati ng over a network, for sending\\noutput to a printer, for handling communication between pro grams, and in general for doing\\nall the standard things that a computer has to do. Microsoft W indows provides its own set\\nof subroutines for programmers to use, and they are quite a bi t diﬀerent from the subroutines\\nused on the Mac. Linux has several diﬀerent GUI toolboxes for the programmer to choose from.\\nThe analogy of a “toolbox” is a good one to keep in mind. Every p rogramming project\\ninvolves a mixture of innovation and reuse of existing tools . A programmer is given a set of\\ntools to work with, starting with the set of basic tools that a re built into the language: things\\nlike variables, assignment statements, if statements, and loops. T o these, the programmer can\\nadd existing toolboxes full of routines that have already be en written for performing certain\\ntasks. These tools, if they are well-designed, can be used as true black boxes: They can be called\\nto perform their assigned tasks without worrying about the p articular steps they go through to\\naccomplish those tasks. The innovative part of programming is to take all these tools and apply\\nthem to some particular project or problem (word-processin g, keeping track of bank accounts,\\nprocessing image data from a space probe, W eb browsing, comp uter games, . . . ). This is called\\napplications programming .\\nA software toolbox is a kind of black box, and it presents a cer tain interface to the program-\\nmer. This interface is a speciﬁcation of what routines are in the toolbox, what parameters they\\nuse, and what tasks they perform. This information constitu tes the API , or Applications\\nProgramming Interface , associated with the toolbox. The Macintosh API is a speciﬁc ation\\nof all the routines available in the Macintosh T oolbox. A com pany that makes some hard-\\nware device—say a card for connecting a computer to a network —might publish an API for\\nthat device consisting of a list of routines that programmer s can call in order to communicate\\nwith and control the device. Scientists who write a set of rou tines for doing some kind of\\ncomplex computation—such as solving “diﬀerential equatio ns,” say—would provide an API to\\nallow others to use those routines without understanding th e details of the computations they\\nperform.\\n∗ ∗ ∗'),\n",

APIS, P ACKAGES, AND JA V ADOC 141\\nThe Java programming language is supplemented by a large, st andard API. Y ou’ve seen\\npart of this API already , in the form of mathematical subrout ines such as Math.sqrt(), the\\nString data type and its associated routines, and the System.out.print() routines. The\\nstandard Java API includes routines for working with graphi cal user interfaces, for network\\ncommunication, for reading and writing ﬁles, and more. It’s tempting to think of these routines\\nas being built into the Java language, but they are technical ly subroutines that have been\\nwritten and made available for use in Java programs.\\nJava is platform-independent. That is, the same program can run on platforms as diverse as\\nMacintosh, Windows, Linux, and others. The same Java API mus t work on all these platforms.\\nBut notice that it is the interface that is platform-independent; the implementation varies\\nfrom one platform to another. A Java system on a particular co mputer includes implementations\\nof all the standard API routines. A Java program includes onl y calls to those routines. When\\nthe Java interpreter executes a program and encounters a cal l to one of the standard routines,\\nit will pull up and execute the implementation of that routin e which is appropriate for the\\nparticular platform on which it is running. This is a very pow erful idea. It means that you only\\nneed to learn one API to program for a wide variety of platform s.\\n4.5.2 Java’s Standard Packages\\nLike all subroutines in Java, the routines in the standard AP I are grouped into classes. T o\\nprovide larger-scale organization, classes in Java can be g rouped into packages, which were\\nintroduced brieﬂy in Subsection 2.6.4. Y ou can have even hig her levels of grouping, since\\npackages can also contain other packages. In fact, the entir e standard Java API is implemented\\nin several packages. One of these, which is named “ java”, contains several non-GUI packages\\nas well as the original A WT graphics user interface classes. Another package, “ javax”, was\\nadded in Java version 1.2 and contains the classes used by the Swing graphical user interface\\nand other additions to the API.\\nA package can contain both classes and other packages. A pack age that is contained in\\nanother package is sometimes called a “sub-package.” Both t he java package and the javax\\npackage contain sub-packages. One of the sub-packages of java, for example, is called “ awt”.\\nSince awt is contained within java, its full name is actually java.awt. This package con-\\ntains classes that represent GUI components such as buttons and menus in the A WT, the\\nolder of the two Java GUI toolboxes, which is no longer widely used. However, java.awt also\\ncontains a number of classes that form the foundation for all GUI programming, such as the\\nGraphics class which provides routines for drawing on the screen, the Color class which repre-\\nsents colors, and the Font class which represents the fonts that are used to display cha racters\\non the screen. Since these classes are contained in the packa ge java.awt, their full names\\nare actually java.awt.Graphics, java.awt.Color, and java.awt.Font. (I hope that by now\\nyou’ve gotten the hang of how this naming thing works in Java. ) Similarly , javax contains\\na sub-package named javax.swing, which includes such classes as javax.swing.JButton,\\njavax.swing.JMenu, and javax.swing.JFrame. The GUI classes in javax.swing, together\\nwith the foundational classes in java.awt, are all part of the API that makes it possible to\\nprogram graphical user interfaces in Java.\\nThe java package includes several other sub-packages, such as java.io, which provides fa-\\ncilities for input/output, java.net, which deals with network communication, and java.util,\\nwhich provides a variety of “utility” classes. The most basi c package is called java.lang. This\\npackage contains fundamental classes such as String, Math, Integer, and Double.\\nIt might be helpful to look at a graphical representation of t he levels of nesting in the'),\n",

Many of these are rather\\nobscure or very specialized, but you might want to browse thr ough the documentation to see\\nwhat is available. As I write this, the documentation for the complete API can be found at\\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html\\nEven an expert programmer won’t be familiar with the entire A PI, or even a majority of it. In\\nthis book, you’ll only encounter several dozen classes, and those will be suﬃcient for writing a\\nwide variety of programs.\\n4.5.3 Using Classes from Packages\\nLet’s say that you want to use the class java.awt.Color in a program that you are writing.\\nLike any class, java.awt.Color is a type, which means that you can use it to declare variables\\nand parameters and to specify the return type of a function. O ne way to do this is to use the\\nfull name of the class as the name of the type. F or example, sup pose that you want to declare\\na variable named rectColor of type java.awt.Color. Y ou could say:\\njava.awt.Color rectColor;\\nThis is just an ordinary variable declaration of the form “ ⟨type-name⟩ ⟨variable-name⟩;”. Of\\ncourse, using the full name of every class can get tiresome, s o Java makes it possible to avoid\\nusing the full name of a class by importing the class. If you put\\nimport java.awt.Color;\\nat the beginning of a Java source code ﬁle, then, in the rest of the ﬁle, you can abbreviate the\\nfull name java.awt.Color to just the simple name of the class, Color. Note that the import'),\n",

Alt hough it is sometimes referred\\nto as a statement, it is more properly called an import directive since it is not a statement\\nin the usual sense. Using this import directive would allow you to say\\nColor rectColor;\\nto declare the variable. Note that the only eﬀect of the import directive is to allow you to use\\nsimple class names instead of full “package.class” names; y ou aren’t really importing anything\\nsubstantial. If you leave out the import directive, you can still access the class—you just have\\nto use its full name. There is a shortcut for importing all the classes from a given package. Y ou\\ncan import all the classes from java.awt by saying\\nimport java.awt.*;\\nThe “ *” is a wildcard that matches every class in the package. (However, it does no t match\\nsub-packages; you cannot import the entire contents of all the sub-packages of the java package\\nby saying import java.*.)\\nSome programmers think that using a wildcard in an import statement is bad style, since\\nit can make a large number of class names available that you ar e not going to use and might\\nnot even know about. They think it is better to explicitly imp ort each individual class that\\nyou want to use. In my own programming, I often use wildcards t o import all the classes from\\nthe most relevant packages, and use individual imports when I am using just one or two classes\\nfrom a given package.\\nIn fact, any Java program that uses a graphical user interfac e is likely to use many\\nclasses from the java.awt and java.swing packages as well as from another package named\\njava.awt.event, and I usually begin such programs with\\nimport java.awt.*;\\nimport java.awt.event.*;\\nimport javax.swing.*;\\nA program that works with networking might include the line “ import java.net.*;”, while\\none that reads or writes ﬁles might use “ import java.io.*;”. (But when you start importing\\nlots of packages in this way , you have to be careful about one t hing: It’s possible for two classes\\nthat are in diﬀerent packages to have the same name. F or examp le, both the java.awt package\\nand the java.util package contain classes named List. If you import both java.awt.* and\\njava.util.*, the simple name List will be ambiguous. If you try to declare a variable of type\\nList, you will get a compiler error message about an ambiguous cla ss name. The solution is\\nsimple: Use the full name of the class, either java.awt.List or java.util.List. Another\\nsolution, of course, is to use import to import the individual classes you need, instead of\\nimporting entire packages.)\\nBecause the package java.lang is so fundamental, all the classes in java.lang are auto-\\nmatically imported into every program. It’s as if every program began w ith the statement\\n“ import java.lang.*;”. This is why we have been able to use the class name String instead\\nof java.lang.String, and Math.sqrt() instead of java.lang.Math.sqrt(). It would still,\\nhowever, be perfectly legal to use the longer forms of the nam es.\\nProgrammers can create new packages. Suppose that you want s ome classes that you are\\nwriting to be in a package named utilities. Then the source code ﬁle that deﬁnes those\\nclasses must begin with the line\\npackage utilities;'),\n",

F urthermore, as mentioned in\\nSubsection 2.6.4, the source code ﬁle would be placed in a fol der with the same name as the\\npackage. A class that is in a package automatically has acces s to other classes in the same\\npackage; that is, a class doesn’t have to import the package i n which it is deﬁned.\\nIn projects that deﬁne large numbers of classes, it makes sen se to organize those classes\\ninto packages.

Recall that one type of Java comment begins w ith /* and ends with */. A\\nJavadoc comment takes the same form, but it begins with /** rather than simply /*. Y ou\\nhave already seen comments of this form in some of the example s in this book, such as this\\nsubroutine from Section 4.3:\\n/**\\n* This subroutine prints a 3N+1 sequence to standard output, using\\n* startingValue as the initial value of N. It also prints the n umber\\n* of terms in the sequence. The value of the parameter, startingValue,\\n* must be a positive integer.\\n*/\\nstatic void print3NSequence(int startingValue) { ...\\nNote that the Javadoc comment is placed just before the subroutine that it is commenting\\non. This rule is always followed. Y ou can have Javadoc commen ts for subroutines, for member\\nvariables, and for classes. The Javadoc comment always imme diately precedes the thing it is\\ncommenting on.\\nLike any comment, a Javadoc comment is ignored by the compute r when the ﬁle is compiled.\\nBut there is a tool called javadoc that reads Java source code ﬁles, extracts any Javadoc'),\n",

By default, javadoc will only collect information about public\\nclasses, subroutines, and member variables, but it allows t he option of creating documentation\\nfor non-public things as well. If javadoc doesn’t ﬁnd any Javadoc comment for something, it\\nwill construct one, but the comment will contain only basic i nformation such as the name and\\ntype of a member variable or the name, return type, and parame ter list of a subroutine. This\\nis syntactic information. T o add information about semantics and pragma tics, you have to\\nwrite a Javadoc comment.\\nAs an example, you can look at the documentation W eb page for T extIO. The documentation\\npage was created by applying the javadoc tool to the source code ﬁle, TextIO.java. If you\\nhave downloaded the on-line version of this book, the docume ntation can be found in the\\nTextIO Javadoc directory , or you can ﬁnd a link to it in the on-line version of this section.\\nIn a Javadoc comment, the *’s at the start of each line are optional. The javadoc tool\\nwill remove them. In addition to normal text, the comment can contain certain special codes.\\nF or one thing, the comment can contain HTML mark-up commands. HTML is the language\\nthat is used to create web pages, and Javadoc comments are mea nt to be shown on web pages.\\nThe javadoc tool will copy any HTML commands in the comments to the web pag es that it\\ncreates. Y ou’ll learn some basic HTML in Section 6.2, but as a n example, you can add <p> to\\nindicate the start of a new paragraph. (Generally , in the abs ence of HTML commands, blank\\nlines and extra spaces in the comment are ignored.)\\nIn addition to HTML commands, Javadoc comments can include doc tags , which are\\nprocessed as commands by the javadoc tool. A doc tag has a name that begins with the\\ncharacter @. I will only discuss three tags: @param, @return, and @throws. These tags are used\\nin Javadoc comments for subroutines to provide information about its parameters, its return\\nvalue, and the exceptions that it might throw. These tags are always placed at the end of the\\ncomment, after any description of the subroutine itself. Th e syntax for using them is:\\n@param ⟨parameter-name ⟩ ⟨ description-of-parameter ⟩\\n@return ⟨description-of-return-value ⟩\\n@throws ⟨exception-class-name ⟩ ⟨ description-of-exception ⟩\\nThe ⟨descriptions⟩ can extend over several lines. The description ends at the ne xt tag or at the\\nend of the comment. Y ou can include a @param tag for every parameter of the subroutine and a\\n@throws for as many types of exception as you want to document. Y ou sho uld have a @return\\ntag only for a non-void subroutine. These tags do not have to b e given in any particular order.\\nHere is an example that doesn’t do anything exciting but that does use all three types of\\ndoc tag:\\n/**\\n* This subroutine computes the area of a rectangle, given its width\\n* and its height. The length and the width should be positive n umbers.\\n* @param width the length of one side of the rectangle\\n* @param height the length the second side of the rectangle\\n* @return the area of the rectangle\\n* @throws IllegalArgumentException if either the width or the height\\n* is a negative number.\\n*/\\npublic static double areaOfRectangle( double length, double width ) {\\nif ( width < 0 || height < 0 )\\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\"Sides must have positive length.\");'),\n",

I encoura ge you to use them in your\\nown code, even if you don’t plan to generate W eb page document ation of your work, since it’s\\na standard format that other Java programmers will be famili ar with.\\nIf you do want to create W eb-page documentation, you need to r un the javadoc tool. This\\ntool is available as a command in the Java Development Kit tha t was discussed in Section 2.6.\\nY ou can use javadoc in a command line interface similarly to the way that the javac and\\njava commands are used. Javadoc can also be applied in the Eclipse integrated development\\nenvironment that was also discussed in Section 2.6: Just rig ht-click the class or package that\\nyou want to document in the Package Explorer, select “Export ,” and select “Javadoc” in the\\nwindow that pops up. I won’t go into any of the details here; se e the documentation.\\n4.6 More on Program Design\\nUnderstanding how programs work is one thing. Designing a program to perform some\\nparticular task is another thing altogether. In Section 3.2 , I discussed how pseudocode and\\nstepwise reﬁnement can be used to methodically develop an al gorithm. W e can now see how\\nsubroutines can ﬁt into the process.\\nStepwise reﬁnement is inherently a top-down process, but th e process does have a “bottom,”\\nthat is, a point at which you stop reﬁning the pseudocode algo rithm and translate what you have\\ndirectly into proper programming language. In the absence o f subroutines, the process would\\nnot bottom out until you get down to the level of assignment st atements and very primitive\\ninput/output operations. But if you have subroutines lying around to perform certain useful\\ntasks, you can stop reﬁning as soon as you’ve managed to expre ss your algorithm in terms of\\nthose tasks.\\nThis allows you to add a bottom-up element to the top-down app roach of stepwise re-\\nﬁnement. Given a problem, you might start by writing some sub routines that perform tasks\\nrelevant to the problem domain. The subroutines become a too lbox of ready-made tools that\\nyou can integrate into your algorithm as you develop it. (Alt ernatively , you might be able to\\nbuy or ﬁnd a software toolbox written by someone else, contai ning subroutines that you can\\nuse in your project as black boxes.)\\nSubroutines can also be helpful even in a strict top-down app roach. As you reﬁne your\\nalgorithm, you are free at any point to take any sub-task in th e algorithm and make it into a\\nsubroutine. Developing that subroutine then becomes a sepa rate problem, which you can work\\non separately . Y our main algorithm will merely call the subr outine. This, of course, is just\\na way of breaking your problem down into separate, smaller pr oblems. It is still a top-down\\napproach because the top-down analysis of the problem tells you what subroutines to write.\\nIn the bottom-up approach, you start by writing or obtaining subroutines that are relevant to\\nthe problem domain, and you build your solution to the proble m on top of that foundation of\\nsubroutines.\\n4.6.1 Preconditions and Postconditions\\nWhen working with subroutines as building blocks, it is impo rtant to be clear about how a\\nsubroutine interacts with the rest of the program. This inte raction is speciﬁed by the contract'),\n",

MORE ON PROGRAM DESIGN 147\\nof the subroutine, as discussed in Section 4.1. A convenient way to express the contract of a\\nsubroutine is in terms of preconditions and postconditions.\\nThe precondition of a subroutine is something that must be tr ue when the subroutine\\nis called, if the subroutine is to work correctly . F or exampl e, for the built-in function\\nMath.sqrt(x), a precondition is that the parameter, x, is greater than or equal to zero, since it\\nis not possible to take the square root of a negative number. I n terms of a contract, a precon-\\ndition represents an obligation of the caller of the subroutine. If you call a subroutine without\\nmeeting its precondition, then there is no reason to expect i t to work properly . The program\\nmight crash or give incorrect results, but you can only blame yourself, not the subroutine.\\nA postcondition of a subroutine represents the other side of the contract. It is something\\nthat will be true after the subroutine has run (assuming that its preconditions were met—and\\nthat there are no bugs in the subroutine). The postcondition of the function Math.sqrt() is\\nthat the square of the value that is returned by this function is equal to the parameter that is\\nprovided when the subroutine is called. Of course, this will only be true if the preconditiion—\\nthat the parameter is greater than or equal to zero—is met. A p ostcondition of the built-in\\nsubroutine System.out.print() is that the value of the parameter has been displayed on the\\nscreen.\\nPreconditions most often give restrictions on the acceptab le values of parameters, as in the\\nexample of Math.sqrt(x). However, they can also refer to global variables that are us ed in\\nthe subroutine. The postcondition of a subroutine speciﬁes the task that it performs. F or a\\nfunction, the postcondition should specify the value that t he function returns.\\nSubroutines are often described by comments that explicitl y specify their preconditions and\\npostconditions. When you are given a pre-written subroutin e, a statement of its preconditions\\nand postconditions tells you how to use it and what it does. Wh en you are assigned to write\\na subroutine, the preconditions and postconditions give yo u an exact speciﬁcation of what the\\nsubroutine is expected to do. I will use this approach in the e xample that constitutes the rest\\nof this section. The comments are given in the form of Javadoc comments, but I will explicitly\\nlabel the preconditions and postconditions. (Many compute r scientists think that new doc\\ntags @precondition and @postcondition should be added to the Javadoc system for explicit\\nlabeling of preconditions and postconditions, but that has not yet been done.)\\n4.6.2 A Design Example\\nLet’s work through an example of program design using subrou tines. In this example, we will\\nuse prewritten subroutines as building blocks and we will al so design new subroutines that we\\nneed to complete the project.\\nSuppose that I have found an already-written class called Mosaic. This class allows a\\nprogram to work with a window that displays little colored re ctangles arranged in rows and\\ncolumns. The window can be opened, closed, and otherwise man ipulated with static member\\nsubroutines deﬁned in the Mosaic class. In fact, the class deﬁnes a toolbox or API that can be\\nused for working with such windows. Here are some of the avail able routines in the API, with\\nJavadoc-style comments:\\n/**\\n* Opens a \"mosaic\" window on the screen.\\n*\\n* Precondition: The parameters rows, cols, w, and h are posit ive integers.\\n* Postcondition: A window is open on the screen that can displ ay rows and\\n* columns of colored rectangles.

I want to ﬁll the\\nwindow with randomly colored squares, and then randomly cha nge the colors in a loop that\\ncontinues as long as the window is open. “Randomly change the colors” could mean a lot\\nof diﬀerent things, but after thinking for a while, I decide i t would be interesting to have a\\n“disturbance” that wanders randomly around the window, cha nging the color of each square\\nthat it encounters. Here’s a picture showing what the conten ts of the window might look like\\nat one point in time:\\nWith basic routines for manipulating the window as a foundat ion, I can turn to the speciﬁc\\nproblem at hand. A basic outline for my program is\\nOpen a Mosaic window\\nFill window with random colors;\\nMove around, changing squares at random.\\nFilling the window with random colors seems like a nice coher ent task that I can work on\\nseparately , so let’s decide to write a separate subroutine t o do it. The third step can be\\nexpanded a bit more, into the steps: Start in the middle of the window, then keep moving to a\\nnew square and changing the color of that square. This should continue as long as the mosaic\\nwindow is still open. Thus we can reﬁne the algorithm to:\\nOpen a Mosaic window\\nFill window with random colors;\\nSet the current position to the middle square in the window;\\nAs long as the mosaic window is open:\\nRandomly change color of the square at the current position;\\nMove current position up, down, left, or right, at random;'),\n",

SUBROUTINES\\nI need to represent the current position in some way . That can be done with two int variables\\nnamed currentRow and currentColumn that hold the row number and the column number of\\nthe square where the disturbance is currently located. I’ll use 10 rows and 20 columns of squares\\nin my mosaic, so setting the current position to be in the cent er means setting currentRow to 5\\nand currentColumn to 10. I already have a subroutine, Mosaic.open(), to open the window,\\nand I have a function, Mosaic.isOpen(), to test whether the window is open. T o keep the\\nmain routine simple, I decide that I will write two more subro utines of my own to carry out\\nthe two tasks in the while loop. The algorithm can then be writ ten in Java as:\\nMosaic.open(10,20,10,10)\\nfillWithRandomColors();\\ncurrentRow = 5; // Middle row, halfway down the window.\\ncurrentColumn = 10; // Middle column.\\nwhile ( Mosaic.isOpen() ) {\\nchangeToRandomColor(currentRow, currentColumn);\\nrandomMove();\\n}\\nWith the proper wrapper, this is essentially the main() routine of my program. It turns out I\\nhave to make one small modiﬁcation: T o prevent the animation from running too fast, the line\\n“ Mosaic.delay(20);” is added to the while loop.\\nThe main() routine is taken care of, but to complete the program, I still have to write the\\nsubroutines fillWithRandomColors(), changeToRandomColor(int,int), and randomMove().\\nW riting each of these subroutines is a separate, small task. The fillWithRandomColors()\\nroutine is deﬁned by the postcondition that “each of the rect angles in the mosaic has been\\nchanged to a random color.” Pseudocode for an algorithm to ac complish this task can be given\\nas:\\nFor each row:\\nFor each column:\\nset the square in that row and column to a random color\\n“F or each row” and “for each column” can be implemented as for loops. W e’ve already planned\\nto write a subroutine changeToRandomColor that can be used to set the color. (The possi-\\nbility of reusing subroutines in several places is one of the big payoﬀs of using them!) So,\\nfillWithRandomColors() can be written in proper Java as:\\nstatic void fillWithRandomColors() {\\nfor (int row = 0; row < 10; row++)\\nfor (int column = 0; column < 20; column++)\\nchangeToRandomColor(row,column);\\n}\\nT urning to the changeToRandomColor subroutine, we already have a method in the Mosaic\\nclass, Mosaic.setColor(), that can be used to change the color of a square. If we want a ra n-\\ndom color, we just have to choose random values for r, g, and b. According to the precondition\\nof the Mosaic.setColor() subroutine, these random values must be integers in the rang e from\\n0 to 255. A formula for randomly selecting such an integer is “ (int)(256*Math.random())”.\\nSo the random color subroutine becomes:\\nstatic void changeToRandomColor(int rowNum, int colNum) {\\nint red = (int)(256*Math.random());\\nint green = (int)(256*Math.random());\\nint blue = (int)(256*Math.random());'),\n",

MORE ON PROGRAM DESIGN 151\\nmosaic.setColor(rowNum,colNum,red,green,blue);\\n}\\nFinally , consider the randomMove subroutine, which is supposed to randomly move the\\ndisturbance up, down, left, or right. T o make a random choice among four directions, we\\ncan choose a random integer in the range 0 to 3. If the integer i s 0, move in one direction;\\nif it is 1, move in another direction; and so on. The position o f the disturbance is given\\nby the variables currentRow and currentColumn. T o “move up” means to subtract 1 from\\ncurrentRow. This leaves open the question of what to do if currentRow becomes -1, which\\nwould put the disturbance above the window. Rather than let t his happen, I decide to move\\nthe disturbance to the opposite edge of the applet by setting currentRow to 9. (Remember\\nthat the 10 rows are numbered from 0 to 9.) Moving the disturba nce down, left, or right is\\nhandled similarly . If we use a switch statement to decide which direction to move, the code\\nfor randomMove becomes:\\nint directionNum;\\ndirectionNum = (int)(4*Math.random());\\nswitch (directionNum) {\\ncase 0: // move up\\ncurrentRow--;\\nif (currentRow < 0) // CurrentRow is outside the mosaic;\\ncurrentRow = 9; // move it to the opposite edge.\\nbreak;\\ncase 1: // move right\\ncurrentColumn++;\\nif (currentColumn >= 20)\\ncurrentColumn = 0;\\nbreak;\\ncase 2: // move down\\ncurrentRow++;\\nif (currentRow >= 10)\\ncurrentRow = 0;\\nbreak;\\ncase 3: // move left\\ncurrentColumn--;\\nif (currentColumn < 0)\\ncurrentColumn = 19;\\nbreak;\\n}\\n4.6.3 The Program\\nPutting this all together, we get the following complete pro gram. Note that I’ve added Javadoc-\\nstyle comments for the class itself and for each of the subrou tines. The variables currentRow\\nand currentColumn are deﬁned as static members of the class, rather than local v ariables,\\nbecause each of them is used in several diﬀerent subroutines . This program actually depends\\non two other classes, Mosaic and another class called MosaicCanvas that is used by Mosaic.\\nIf you want to compile and run this program, both of these clas ses must be available to the\\nprogram.'),\n",

SUBROUTINES\\n4.7.1 Initialization in Declarations\\nWhen a variable declaration is executed, memory is allocate d for the variable. This memory\\nmust be initialized to contain some deﬁnite value before the variable can be used in an expres-\\nsion. In the case of a local variable, the declaration is ofte n followed closely by an assignment\\nstatement that does the initialization. F or example,\\nint count; // Declare a variable named count.\\ncount = 0; // Give count its initial value.\\nHowever, the truth about declaration statements is that it i s legal to include the initializa-\\ntion of the variable in the declaration statement. The two st atements above can therefore be\\nabbreviated as\\nint count = 0; // Declare count and give it an initial value.\\nThe computer still executes this statement in two steps: Dec lare the variable count, then assign\\nthe value 0 to the newly created variable. The initial value d oes not have to be a constant. It\\ncan be any expression. It is legal to initialize several vari ables in one declaration statement.\\nF or example,\\nchar firstInitial = ’D’, secondInitial = ’E’;\\nint x, y = 1; // OK, but only y has been initialized!\\nint N = 3, M = N+2; // OK, N is initialized\\n// before its value is used.\\nThis feature is especially common in for loops, since it makes it possible to declare a loop control\\nvariable at the same point in the loop where it is initialized . Since the loop control variable\\ngenerally has nothing to do with the rest of the program outsi de the loop, it’s reasonable to\\nhave its declaration in the part of the program where it’s act ually used. F or example:\\nfor ( int i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {\\nSystem.out.println(i);\\n}\\nAgain, you should remember that this is simply an abbreviati on for the following, where I’ve\\nadded an extra pair of braces to show that i is considered to be local to the for statement and\\nno longer exists after the for loop ends:\\n{\\nint i;\\nfor ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {\\nSystem.out.println(i);\\n}\\n}\\n(Y ou might recall, by the way , that for “for-each” loops, the special type of for statement\\nthat is used with enumerated types, declaring the variable i n the for is required. See Subsec-\\ntion 3.4.4.)\\nA member variable can also be initialized at the point where i t is declared, just as for a\\nlocal variable. F or example:\\npublic class Bank {\\nstatic double interestRate = 0.05;\\nstatic int maxWithdrawal = 200;'),\n",

THE TRUTH ABOUT DECLARA TIONS 155\\n.\\n. // More variables and subroutines.\\n.\\n}\\nA static member variable is created as soon as the class is loa ded by the Java interpreter, and\\nthe initialization is also done at that time. In the case of me mber variables, this is not simply\\nan abbreviation for a declaration followed by an assignment statement. Declaration statements\\nare the only type of statement that can occur outside of a subr outine. Assignment statements\\ncannot, so the following is illegal:\\npublic class Bank {\\nstatic double interestRate;\\ninterestRate = 0.05; // ILLEGAL:\\n. // Can’t be outside a subroutine!:\\n.\\n.\\nBecause of this, declarations of member variables often inc lude initial values. In fact, as\\nmentioned in Subsection 4.2.4, if no initial value is provid ed for a member variable, then a\\ndefault initial value is used. F or example, when declaring a n integer member variable, count,\\n“ static int count;” is equivalent to “ static int count = 0;”.\\n4.7.2 Named Constants\\nSometimes, the value of a variable is not supposed to change a fter it is initialized. F or example,\\nin the above example where interestRate is initialized to the value 0.05, it’s quite possible\\nthat that is meant to be the value throughout the entire progr am. In this case, the programmer\\nis probably deﬁning the variable, interestRate, to give a meaningful name to the otherwise\\nmeaningless number, 0.05. It’s easier to understand what’s going on when a program say s\\n“ principal += principal*interestRate;” rather than “ principal += principal*0.05;”.\\nIn Java, the modiﬁer “ final” can be applied to a variable declaration to ensure that the\\nvalue stored in the variable cannot be changed after the vari able has been initialized. F or\\nexample, if the member variable interestRate is declared with\\nfinal static double interestRate = 0.05;\\nthen it would be impossible for the value of interestRate to change anywhere else in the\\nprogram. Any assignment statement that tries to assign a val ue to interestRate will be\\nrejected by the computer as a syntax error when the program is compiled.\\nIt is legal to apply the final modiﬁer to local variables and even to formal parameters,\\nbut it is most useful for member variables. I will often refer to a static member variable that\\nis declared to be final as a named constant , since its value remains constant for the whole\\ntime that the program is running. The readability of a progra m can be greatly enhanced by\\nusing named constants to give meaningful names to important quantities in the program. A\\nrecommended style rule for named constants is to give them na mes that consist entirely of\\nupper case letters, with underscore characters to separate words if necessary . F or example, the\\npreferred style for the interest rate constant would be\\nfinal static double INTEREST\\nRATE = 0.05;\\nThis is the style that is generally used in Java’s standard cl asses, which deﬁne many named\\nconstants. F or example, we have already seen that the Math class contains a variable Math.PI.\\nThis variable is declared in the Math class as a “public ﬁnal static” variable of type double.'),\n",

SUBROUTINES\\nSimilarly , the Color class contains named constants such as Color.RED and Color.YELLOW\\nwhich are public ﬁnal static variables of type Color. Many named constants are created just to\\ngive meaningful names to be used as parameters in subroutine calls. F or example, the standard\\nclass named Font contains named constants Font.PLAIN, Font.BOLD, and Font.ITALIC. These\\nconstants are used for specifying diﬀerent styles of text wh en calling various subroutines in the\\nFont class.\\nEnumerated type constants (See Subsection 2.3.3.) are also examples of named constants.\\nThe enumerated type deﬁnition\\nenum Alignment { LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER }\\ndeﬁnes the constants Alignment.LEFT, Alignment.RIGHT, and Alignment.CENTER. T echnically ,\\nAlignment is a class, and the three constants are public ﬁnal static mem bers of that class.\\nDeﬁning the enumerated type is similar to deﬁning three cons tants of type, say , int:\\npublic static final int ALIGNMENT LEFT = 0;\\npublic static final int ALIGNMNENT RIGHT = 1;\\npublic static final int ALIGNMENT CENTER = 2;\\nIn fact, this is how things were generally done before the int roduction of enumerated types in\\nJava 5.0, and it is what is done with the constants Font.PLAIN, Font.BOLD, and Font.ITALIC\\nmentioned above. Using the integer constants, you could deﬁ ne a variable of type int and assign\\nit the values ALIGNMENT LEFT, ALIGNMENT RIGHT, or ALIGNMENT CENTER to represent diﬀerent\\ntypes of alignment. The only problem with this is that the com puter has no way of knowing\\nthat you intend the value of the variable to represent an alig nment, and it will not raise any\\nobjection if the value that is assigned to the variable is not one of the three valid alignment\\nvalues.\\nWith the enumerated type, on the other hand, the only values t hat can be assigned to\\na variable of type Alignment are the constant values that are listed in the deﬁnition of th e\\nenumerated type. Any attempt to assign an invalid value to th e variable is a syntax error\\nwhich the computer will detect when the program is compiled. This extra safety is one of the\\nmajor advantages of enumerated types.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nCuriously enough, one of the major reasons to use named const ants is that it’s easy to\\nchange the value of a named constant. Of course, the value can ’t change while the program\\nis running. But between runs of the program, it’s easy to chan ge the value in the source code\\nand recompile the program. Consider the interest rate examp le. It’s quite possible that the\\nvalue of the interest rate is used many times throughout the p rogram. Suppose that the bank\\nchanges the interest rate and the program has to be modiﬁed. I f the literal number 0.05 were\\nused throughout the program, the programmer would have to tr ack down each place where\\nthe interest rate is used in the program and change the rate to the new value. (This is made\\neven harder by the fact that the number 0.05 might occur in the program with other meanings\\nbesides the interest rate, as well as by the fact that someone might have used 0.025 to represent\\nhalf the interest rate.) On the other hand, if the named const ant INTEREST RATE is declared\\nand used consistently throughout the program, then only the single line where the constant is\\ninitialized needs to be changed.\\nAs an extended example, I will give a new version of the RandomMosaicWalk program from\\nthe previous section. This version uses named constants to r epresent the number of rows in\\nthe mosaic, the number of columns, and the size of each little square. The three constants are\\ndeclared as final static member variables with the lines:'),\n",

The variable\\nname can be used in at least some part of the program source cod e to refer to that memory or\\nto the data that is stored in the memory . The portion of the pro gram source code where the\\nvariable name is valid is called the scope of the variable. Similarly , we can refer to the scope\\nof subroutine names and formal parameter names.\\nF or static member subroutines, scope is straightforward. T he scope of a static subroutine\\nis the entire source code of the class in which it is deﬁned. Th at is, it is possible to call the\\nsubroutine from any point in the class, including at a point i n the source code before the point\\nwhere the deﬁnition of the subroutine appears. It is even pos sible to call a subroutine from\\nwithin itself. This is an example of something called “recur sion,” a fairly advanced topic that\\nwe will return to later.\\nF or a variable that is declared as a static member variable in a class, the situation is similar,\\nbut with one complication. It is legal to have a local variabl e or a formal parameter that has\\nthe same name as a member variable. In that case, within the sc ope of the local variable or\\nparameter, the member variable is hidden. Consider, for example, a class named Game that\\nhas the form:\\npublic class Game {\\nstatic int count; // member variable\\nstatic void playGame() {\\nint count; // local variable\\n.\\n. // Some statements to define playGame()\\n.\\n}'),\n",

THE TRUTH ABOUT DECLARA TIONS 159\\n.\\n. // More variables and subroutines.\\n.\\n} // end Game\\nIn the statements that make up the body of the playGame() subroutine, the name “ count”\\nrefers to the local variable. In the rest of the Game class, “ count” refers to the member vari-\\nable, unless hidden by other local variables or parameters n amed count. However, there is\\none further complication. The member variable named count can also be referred to by the\\nfull name Game.count. Usually , the full name is only used outside the class where count is\\ndeﬁned. However, there is no rule against using it inside the class. The full name, Game.count,\\ncan be used inside the playGame() subroutine to refer to the member variable. So, the full\\nscope rule is that the scope of a static member variable inclu des the entire class in which it\\nis deﬁned, but where the simple name of the member variable is hidden by a local variable\\nor formal parameter name, the member variable must be referr ed to by its full name of the\\nform ⟨className⟩.⟨variableName⟩. (Scope rules for non-static members are similar to those\\nfor static members, except that, as we shall see, non-static members cannot be used in static\\nsubroutines.)\\nThe scope of a formal parameter of a subroutine is the block th at makes up the body of the\\nsubroutine. The scope of a local variable extends from the de claration statement that deﬁnes\\nthe variable to the end of the block in which the declaration o ccurs. As noted above, it is\\npossible to declare a loop control variable of a for loop in the for statement, as in “ for (int\\ni=0; i < 10; i++)”. The scope of such a declaration is considered as a special c ase: It is\\nvalid only within the for statement and does not extend to the remainder of the block th at\\ncontains the for statement.\\nIt is not legal to redeﬁne the name of a formal parameter or loc al variable within its scope,\\neven in a nested block. F or example, this is not allowed:\\nvoid badSub(int y) {\\nint x;\\nwhile (y > 0) {\\nint x; // ERROR: x is already defined.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n}\\n}\\nIn many languages, this would be legal; the declaration of x in the while loop would hide\\nthe original declaration. It is not legal in Java; however, o nce the block in which a variable is\\ndeclared ends, its name does become available for reuse in Ja va. F or example:\\nvoid goodSub(int y) {\\nwhile (y > 10) {\\nint x;\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n// The scope of x ends here.\\n}\\nwhile (y > 0) {'),\n",

This can’t\\nhappen, for a reason that might be surprising. There is no rul e that variables and subroutines\\nhave to have diﬀerent names. The computer can always tell whe ther a name refers to a variable\\nor to a subroutine, because a subroutine name is always follo wed by a left parenthesis. It’s\\nperfectly legal to have a variable called count and a subroutine called count in the same class.\\n(This is one reason why I often write subroutine names with pa rentheses, as when I talk about\\nthe main() routine. It’s a good idea to think of the parentheses as part o f the name.) Even\\nmore is true: It’s legal to reuse class names to name variable s and subroutines.

S ection 5.5 covers the central\\nideas of object-oriented programming: inheritance and pol ymorphism.

In the older styles of\\nprogramming, a programmer who is faced with some problem mus t identify a computing task\\nthat needs to be performed in order to solve the problem. Prog ramming then consists of\\nﬁnding a sequence of instructions that will accomplish that task. But at the heart of object-\\noriented programming, instead of tasks we ﬁnd objects—enti ties that have behaviors, that hold\\ninformation, and that can interact with one another. Progra mming consists of designing a set\\nof objects that somehow model the problem at hand. Software o bjects in the program can\\nrepresent real or abstract entities in the problem domain. T his is supposed to make the design\\nof the program more natural and hence easier to get right and e asier to understand.\\nT o some extent, OOP is just a change in point of view. W e can thi nk of an object in standard\\nprogramming terms as nothing more than a set of variables tog ether with some subroutines for\\nmanipulating those variables. In fact, it is possible to use object-oriented techniques in any\\nprogramming language. However, there is a big diﬀerence bet ween a language that makes OOP\\npossible and one that actively supports it. An object-orien ted programming language such as\\nJava includes a number of features that make it very diﬀerent from a standard language. In\\norder to make eﬀective use of those features, you have to “ori ent” your thinking correctly .\\n165'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\n5.1.1 Objects, Classes, and Instances\\nObjects are closely related to classes. W e have already been working with classes for several\\nchapters, and we have seen that a class can contain variables and subroutines. If an object is\\nalso a collection of variables and subroutines, how do they d iﬀer from classes? And why does it\\nrequire a diﬀerent type of thinking to understand and use the m eﬀectively? In the one section\\nwhere we worked with objects rather than classes, Section 3. 8, it didn’t seem to make much\\ndiﬀerence: W e just left the word “ static” out of the subroutine deﬁnitions!\\nI have said that classes “describe” objects, or more exactly that the non-static portions of\\nclasses describe objects. But it’s probably not very clear w hat this means. The more usual\\nterminology is to say that objects belong to classes, but this might not be much clearer. (There\\nis a real shortage of English words to properly distinguish a ll the concepts involved. An object\\ncertainly doesn’t “belong” to a class in the same way that a me mber variable “belongs” to a\\nclass.) F rom the point of view of programming, it is more exac t to say that classes are used\\nto create objects. A class is a kind of factory for constructi ng objects. The non-static parts of\\nthe class specify , or describe, what variables and subrouti nes the objects will contain. This is\\npart of the explanation of how objects diﬀer from classes: Ob jects are created and destroyed as\\nthe program runs, and there can be many objects with the same s tructure, if they are created\\nusing the same class.\\nConsider a simple class whose job is to group together a few st atic member variables. F or\\nexample, the following class could be used to store informat ion about the person who is using\\nthe program:\\nclass UserData {\\nstatic String name;\\nstatic int age;\\n}\\nIn a program that uses this class, there is only one copy of eac h of the variables UserData.name\\nand UserData.age. There can only be one “user,” since we only have memory space to store\\ndata about one user. The class, UserData, and the variables it contains exist as long as the\\nprogram runs. Now, consider a similar class that includes no n-static variables:\\nclass PlayerData {\\nString name;\\nint age;\\n}\\nIn this case, there is no such variable as PlayerData.name or PlayerData.age, since name and\\nage are not static members of PlayerData. So, there is nothing much in the class at all—\\nexcept the potential to create objects. But, it’s a lot of pot ential, since it can be used to create\\nany number of objects! Each object will have its own variables called name and age. There\\ncan be many “players” because we can make new objects to repre sent new players on demand.\\nA program might use this class to store information about mul tiple players in a game. Each\\nplayer has a name and an age. When a player joins the game, a new PlayerData object can\\nbe created to represent that player. If a player leaves the ga me, the PlayerData object that\\nrepresents that player can be destroyed. A system of objects in the program is being used to\\ndynamically model what is happening in the game. Y ou can’t do this with “static” variables!\\nIn Section 3.8, we worked with applets, which are objects. Th e reason they didn’t seem to\\nbe any diﬀerent from classes is because we were only working w ith one applet in each class that\\nwe looked at. But one class can be used to make many applets. Th ink of an applet that scrolls'),\n",

OBJECTS AND INST ANCE METHODS 167\\na message across a W eb page. There could be several such apple ts on the same page, all created\\nfrom the same class. If the scrolling message in the applet is stored in a non-static variable,\\nthen each applet will have its own variable, and each applet c an show a diﬀerent message. The\\nsituation is even clearer if you think about windows, which, like applets, are objects. As a\\nprogram runs, many windows might be opened and closed, but al l those windows can belong\\nto the same class. Here again, we have a dynamic situation whe re multiple objects are created\\nand destroyed as a program runs.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nAn object that belongs to a class is said to be an instance of that class. The variables that\\nthe object contains are called instance variables . The subroutines that the object contains\\nare called instance methods . (Recall that in the context of object-oriented programmin g,\\nmethod is a synonym for “subroutine”. F rom now on, since we are doing object-oriented\\nprogramming, I will prefer the term “method.”) F or example, if the PlayerData class, as\\ndeﬁned above, is used to create an object, then that object is an instance of the PlayerData\\nclass, and name and age are instance variables in the object. It is important to reme mber that\\nthe class of an object determines the types of the instance variables; however, the actual data\\nis contained inside the individual objects, not the class. T hus, each object has its own set of\\ndata.\\nAn applet that scrolls a message across a W eb page might inclu de a subroutine named\\nscroll(). Since the applet is an object, this subroutine is an instanc e method of the applet.\\nThe source code for the method is in the class that is used to cr eate the applet. Still, it’s better\\nto think of the instance method as belonging to the object, no t to the class. The non-static\\nsubroutines in the class merely specify the instance method s that every object created from the\\nclass will contain. The scroll() methods in two diﬀerent applets do the same thing in the\\nsense that they both scroll messages across the screen. But t here is a real diﬀerence between\\nthe two scroll() methods. The messages that they scroll can be diﬀerent. Y ou m ight say that\\nthe method deﬁnition in the class speciﬁes what type of behav ior the objects will have, but\\nthe speciﬁc behavior can vary from object to object, dependi ng on the values of their instance\\nvariables.\\nAs you can see, the static and the non-static portions of a cla ss are very diﬀerent things and\\nserve very diﬀerent purposes. Many classes contain only sta tic members, or only non-static.\\nHowever, it is possible to mix static and non-static members in a single class, and we’ll see\\na few examples later in this chapter where it is reasonable to do so. Y ou should distiguish\\nbetween the source code for the class, and the class itself . The source code determines both\\nthe class and the objects that are created from that class. Th e “static” deﬁnitions in the source\\ncode specify the things that are part of the class itself, whe reas the non-static deﬁnitions in the\\nsource code specify things that will become part of every ins tance object that is created from\\nthe class. By the way , static member variables and static mem ber subroutines in a class are\\nsometimes called class variables and class methods , since they belong to the class itself,\\nrather than to instances of that class.\\n5.1.2 F undamentals of Objects\\nSo far, I’ve been talking mostly in generalities, and I haven ’t given you much idea what you\\nhave to put in a program if you want to work with objects. Let’s look at a speciﬁc example to\\nsee how it works. Consider this extremely simpliﬁed version of a Student class, which could be\\nused to store information about students taking a course:'),\n",

This class deﬁnition says that any object that is an instance of the Student\\nclass will include instance variables named name, test1, test2, and test3, and it will include an\\ninstance method named getAverage(). The names and tests in diﬀerent objects will generally\\nhave diﬀerent values. When called for a particular student, the method getAverage() will\\ncompute an average using that student’s test grades. Diﬀerent students can have diﬀerent\\naverages. (Again, this is what it means to say that an instanc e method belongs to an individual\\nobject, not to the class.)\\nIn Java, a class is a type, similar to the built-in types such as int and boolean. So, a class\\nname can be used to specify the type of a variable in a declarat ion statement, the type of a\\nformal parameter, or the return type of a function. F or examp le, a program could deﬁne a\\nvariable named std of type Student with the statement\\nStudent std;\\nHowever, declaring a variable does not create an object! This is an important point, which is\\nrelated to this V ery Important F act:\\nIn Java, no variable can ever hold an object.\\nA variable can only hold a reference to an object.\\nY ou should think of objects as ﬂoating around independently in the computer’s memory . In\\nfact, there is a special portion of memory called the heap where objects live. Instead of holding\\nan object itself, a variable holds the information necessar y to ﬁnd the object in memory . This\\ninformation is called a reference or pointer to the object. In eﬀect, a reference to an object\\nis the address of the memory location where the object is stor ed. When you use a variable of\\nclass type, the computer uses the reference in the variable t o ﬁnd the actual object.\\nIn a program, objects are created using an operator called new, which creates an object\\nand returns a reference to that object. F or example, assumin g that std is a variable of type\\nStudent, declared as above, the assignment statement\\nstd = new Student();\\nwould create a new object which is an instance of the class Student, and it would store a\\nreference to that object in the variable std. The value of the variable is a reference to the\\nobject, not the object itself. It is not quite true, then, to s ay that the object is the “value of\\nthe variable std” (though sometimes it is hard to avoid using this terminolog y). It is certainly\\nnot at all true to say that the object is “stored in the variable std.” The proper terminology\\nis that “the variable std refers to the object,” and I will try to stick to that terminology as\\nmuch as possible.\\nSo, suppose that the variable std refers to an object belonging to the class Student. That\\nobject has instance variables name, test1, test2, and test3. These instance variables can'),\n",

This follows the usual\\nnaming convention that when B is part of A, then the full name of B is A.B. F or example, a\\nprogram might include the lines\\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello, \" + std.name + \". Your test grad es are:\");\\nSystem.out.println(std.test1);\\nSystem.out.println(std.test2);\\nSystem.out.println(std.test3);\\nThis would output the name and test grades from the object to w hich std refers. Simi-\\nlarly , std can be used to call the getAverage() instance method in the object by saying\\nstd.getAverage(). T o print out the student’s average, you could say:\\nSystem.out.println( \"Your average is \" + std.getAverage() );\\nMore generally , you could use std.name any place where a variable of type String is legal.\\nY ou can use it in expressions. Y ou can assign a value to it. Y ou can even use it to call subroutines\\nfrom the String class. F or example, std.name.length() is the number of characters in the\\nstudent’s name.\\nIt is possible for a variable like std, whose type is given by a class, to refer to no object at\\nall. W e say in this case that std holds a null reference . The null reference is written in Java\\nas “ null”. Y ou can store a null reference in the variable std by saying\\nstd = null;\\nand you could test whether the value of std is null by testing\\nif (std == null) . . .\\nIf the value of a variable is null, then it is, of course, illegal to refer to instance variable s\\nor instance methods through that variable—since there is no object, and hence no instance\\nvariables to refer to. F or example, if the value of the variab le std is null, then it would be\\nillegal to refer to std.test1. If your program attempts to use a null reference illegally l ike this,\\nthe result is an error called a null pointer exception .\\nLet’s look at a sequence of statements that work with objects :\\nStudent std, std1, // Declare four variables of\\nstd2, std3; // type Student.\\nstd = new Student(); // Create a new object belonging\\n// to the class Student, and\\n// store a reference to that\\n// object in the variable std.\\nstd1 = new Student(); // Create a second Student object\\n// and store a reference to\\n// it in the variable std1.\\nstd2 = std1; // Copy the reference value in std1\\n// into the variable std2.\\nstd3 = null; // Store a null reference in the\\n// variable std3.\\nstd.name = \"John Smith\"; // Set values of some instance varia bles.\\nstd1.name = \"Mary Jones\";\\n// (Other instance variables have default\\n// initial values of zero.)'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nAfter the computer executes these statements, the situatio n in the computer’s memory looks\\nlike this:\\nThis picture shows variables as little boxes, labeled with t he names of the variables. Objects\\nare shown as boxes with round corners. When a variable contai ns a reference to an object, the\\nvalue of that variable is shown as an arrow pointing to the obj ect. The variable std3, with a\\nvalue of null, doesn’t point anywhere. The arrows from std1 and std2 both point to the same\\nobject. This illustrates a V ery Important Point:\\nWhen one object variable is assigned\\nto another, only a reference is copied.\\nThe object referred to is not copied.\\nWhen the assignment “ std2 = std1;” was executed, no new object was created. Instead, std2\\nwas set to refer to the very same object that std1 refers to. This has some consequences that\\nmight be surprising. F or example, std1.name and std2.name are two diﬀerent names for the\\nsame variable, namely the instance variable in the object th at both std1 and std2 refer to.\\nAfter the string \"Mary Jones\" is assigned to the variable std1.name, it is also true that the\\nvalue of std2.name is \"Mary Jones\". There is a potential for a lot of confusion here, but you\\ncan help protect yourself from it if you keep telling yoursel f, “The object is not in the variable.\\nThe variable just holds a pointer to the object.”\\nY ou can test objects for equality and inequality using the op erators == and !=, but\\nhere again, the semantics are diﬀerent from what you are used to. When you make a test\\n“ if (std1 == std2)”, you are testing whether the values stored in std1 and std2 are the\\nsame. But the values are references to objects, not objects. So, you are testing whether\\nstd1 and std2 refer to the same object, that is, whether they point to the sa me location'),\n",

But sometime s, what you want to\\ncheck is whether the instance variables in the objects have t he same values. T o do that, you\\nwould need to ask whether “ std1.test1 == std2.test1 && std1.test2 == std2.test2 &&\\nstd1.test3 == std2.test3 && std1.name.equals(std2.name)”.\\nI’ve remarked previously that Strings are objects, and I’ve shown the strings \"Mary Jones\"\\nand \"John Smith\" as objects in the above illustration. A variable of type String can only hold\\na reference to a string, not the string itself. It could also h old the value null, meaning that\\nit does not refer to any string at all. This explains why using the == operator to test strings\\nfor equality is not a good idea. Suppose that greeting is a variable of type String, and that\\nthe string it refers to is \"Hello\". Then would the test greeting == \"Hello\" be true? W ell,\\nmaybe, maybe not. The variable greeting and the String literal \"Hello\" each refer to a\\nstring that contains the characters H-e-l-l-o. But the stri ngs could still be diﬀerent objects,\\nthat just happen to contain the same characters. The functio n greeting.equals(\"Hello\")\\ntests whether greeting and \"Hello\" contain the same characters, which is almost certainly\\nthe question you want to ask. The expression greeting == \"Hello\" tests whether greeting\\nand \"Hello\" contain the same characters stored in the same memory location .\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe fact that variables hold references to objects, not obje cts themselves, has a couple of\\nother consequences that you should be aware of. They follow l ogically , if you just keep in mind\\nthe basic fact that the object is not stored in the variable. T he object is somewhere else; the\\nvariable points to it.\\nSuppose that a variable that refers to an object is declared t o be final. This means that\\nthe value stored in the variable can never be changed, once th e variable has been initialized.\\nThe value stored in the variable is a reference to the object. So the variable will continue to\\nrefer to the same object as long as the variable exists. Howev er, this does not prevent the data\\nin the object from changing. The variable is final, not the object. It’s perfectly legal to say\\nfinal Student stu = new Student();\\nstu.name = \"John Doe\"; // Change data in the object;\\n// The value stored in stu is not changed!\\n// It still refers to the same object.\\nNext, suppose that obj is a variable that refers to an object. Let’s consider what ha ppens\\nwhen obj is passed as an actual parameter to a subroutine. The value of obj is assigned to\\na formal parameter in the subroutine, and the subroutine is e xecuted. The subroutine has no\\npower to change the value stored in the variable, obj. It only has a copy of that value. However,\\nthat value is a reference to an object. Since the subroutine h as a reference to the object, it can\\nchange the data stored in the object. After the subroutine en ds, obj still points to the same\\nobject, but the data stored in the object might have changed. Suppose x is a variable of type\\nint and stu is a variable of type Student. Compare:\\nvoid dontChange(int z) { void change(Student s) {\\nz = 42; s.name = \"Fred\";\\n} }\\nThe lines: The lines:\\nx = 17; stu.name = \"Jane\";\\ndontChange(x); change(stu);\\nSystem.out.println(x); System.out.println(stu.name);'),\n",

Recall\\nthat making a member of a class public makes it accessible from anywhere, including from\\nother classes. On the other hand, a private member can only be used in the class where it is\\ndeﬁned.\\nIn the opinion of many programmers, almost all member variab les should be declared\\nprivate. This gives you complete control over what can be done with th e variable. Even\\nif the variable itself is private, you can allow other classe s to ﬁnd out what its value is by pro-\\nviding a public accessor method that returns the value of the variable. F or example, if your\\nclass contains a private member variable, title, of type String, you can provide a method\\npublic String getTitle() {\\nreturn title;\\n}\\nthat returns the value of title. By convention, the name of an accessor method for a variable\\nis obtained by capitalizing the name of variable and adding “ get” in front of the name. So, for\\nthe variable title, we get an accessor method named “get” + “Title”, or getTitle(). Because\\nof this naming convention, accessor methods are more often r eferred to as getter methods . A\\ngetter method provides “read access” to a variable.\\nY ou might also want to allow “write access” to a private variable. That is, you might\\nwant to make it possible for other classes to specify a new val ue for the variable. This is done\\nwith a setter method . (If you don’t like simple, Anglo-Saxon words, you can use th e fancier\\nterm mutator method .) The name of a setter method should consist of “set” followe d by a\\ncapitalized copy of the variable’s name, and it should have a parameter with the same type as\\nthe variable. A setter method for the variable title could be written\\npublic void setTitle( String newTitle ) {\\ntitle = newTitle;\\n}\\nIt is actually very common to provide both a getter and a sette r method for a private\\nmember variable. Since this allows other classes both to see and to change the value of the\\nvariable, you might wonder why not just make the variable public? The reason is that getters\\nand setters are not restricted to simply reading and writing the variable’s value. In fact, they\\ncan take any action at all. F or example, a getter method might keep track of the number of\\ntimes that the variable has been accessed:\\npublic String getTitle() {\\ntitleAccessCount++; // Increment member variable titleAc cessCount.\\nreturn title;\\n}\\nand a setter method might check that the value that is being as signed to the variable is legal:'),\n",

If you’ve used a getter and\\nsetter from the beginning, you can make the modiﬁcation to yo ur class without aﬀecting any of\\nthe classes that use your class. The private member variable is not part of the public interface\\nof your class; only the public getter and setter methods are. If you haven’t used get and set\\nfrom the beginning, you’ll have to contact everyone who uses your class and tell them, “Sorry\\nguys, you’ll have to track down every use that you’ve made of t his variable and change your\\ncode to use my new get and set methods instead.”\\nA couple of ﬁnal notes: Some advanced aspects of Java rely on t he naming convention\\nfor getter and setter methods, so it’s a good idea to follow th e convention rigorously . And\\nthough I’ve been talking about using getter and setter metho ds for a variable, you can deﬁne\\nget and set methods even if there is no variable. A getter and/ or setter method deﬁnes a\\nproperty of the class, that might or might not correspond to a variable . F or example, if a class\\nincludes a public voidinstance method with signature setValue(double), then the class has\\na “property” named value of type double, and it has this property whether or not the class\\nhas a member variable named value.\\n5.2 Constructors and Object Initialization\\nObject types in Javaare very diﬀerent from the primitive types. Simply declarin g a variable\\nwhose type is given as a class does not automatically create a n object of that class. Objects\\nmust be explicitly constructed. F or the computer, the process of constructing an object mea ns,\\nﬁrst, ﬁnding some unused memory in the heap that can be used to hold the object and, second,\\nﬁlling in the object’s instance variables. As a programmer, you don’t care where in memory\\nthe object is stored, but you will usually want to exercise so me control over what initial values\\nare stored in a new object’s instance variables. In many case s, you will also want to do more\\ncomplicated initialization or bookkeeping every time an ob ject is created.\\n5.2.1 Initializing Instance Variables\\nAn instance variable can be assigned an initial value in its d eclaration, just like any other\\nvariable. F or example, consider a class named PairOfDice. An object of this class will represent\\na pair of dice. It will contain two instance variables to repr esent the numbers showing on the\\ndice and an instance method for rolling the dice:\\npublic class PairOfDice {\\npublic int die1 = 3; // Number showing on the first die.\\npublic int die2 = 4; // Number showing on the second die.\\npublic void roll() {\\n// Roll the dice by setting each of the dice to be\\n// a random number between 1 and 6.\\ndie1 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;'),\n",

These\\ninitializations are executed whenever a PairOfDice object is constructed. It’s important to\\nunderstand when and how this happens. There can be many PairOfDice objects. Each time one\\nis created, it gets its own instance variables, and the assig nments “ die1 = 3” and “ die2 = 4”\\nare executed to ﬁll in the values of those variables. T o make t his clearer, consider a variation\\nof the PairOfDice class:\\npublic class PairOfDice {\\npublic int die1 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;\\npublic int die2 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;\\npublic void roll() {\\ndie1 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;\\ndie2 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;\\n}\\n} // end class PairOfDice\\nHere, the dice are initialized to random values, as if a new pa ir of dice were being thrown onto\\nthe gaming table. Since the initialization is executed for e ach new object, a set of random initial\\nvalues will be computed for each new pair of dice. Diﬀerent pa irs of dice can have diﬀerent\\ninitial values. F or initialization of static member variables, of course, the situation is quite\\ndiﬀerent. There is only one copy of a static variable, and initialization of that variable is\\nexecuted just once, when the class is ﬁrst loaded.\\nIf you don’t provide any initial value for an instance variab le, a default initial value is pro-\\nvided automatically . Instance variables of numerical type (int, double, etc.) are automatically\\ninitialized to zero if you provide no other values; boolean variables are initialized to false; and\\nchar variables, to the Unicode character with code number zero. A n instance variable can also\\nbe a variable of object type. F or such variables, the default initial value is null. (In particular,\\nsince Strings are objects, the default initial value for String variables is null.)\\n5.2.2 Constructors\\nObjects are created with the operator, new. F or example, a program that wants to use a\\nPairOfDice object could say:\\nPairOfDice dice; // Declare a variable of type PairOfDice.\\ndice = new PairOfDice(); // Construct a new object and store a\\n// reference to it in the variable.\\nIn this example, “ new PairOfDice()” is an expression that allocates memory for the object,\\ninitializes the object’s instance variables, and then retu rns a reference to the object. This\\nreference is the value of the expression, and that value is st ored by the assignment statement in\\nthe variable, dice, so that after the assignment statement is executed, dice refers to the newly\\ncreated object. Part of this expression, “ PairOfDice()”, looks like a subroutine call, and that\\nis no accident. It is, in fact, a call to a special type of subro utine called a constructor. This\\nmight puzzle you, since there is no such subroutine in the cla ss deﬁnition. However, every class\\nhas at least one constructor. If the programmer doesn’t writ e a constructor deﬁnition in a class,'),\n",

This default constructor\\ndoes nothing beyond the basics: allocate memory and initial ize instance variables. If you want\\nmore than that to happen when an object is created, you can inc lude one or more constructors\\nin the class deﬁnition.\\nThe deﬁnition of a constructor looks much like the deﬁnition of any other subroutine, with\\nthree exceptions. A constructor does not have any return typ e (not even void). The name of\\nthe constructor must be the same as the name of the class in whi ch it is deﬁned. The only\\nmodiﬁers that can be used on a constructor deﬁnition are the a ccess modiﬁers public, private,\\nand protected. (In particular, a constructor can’t be declared static.)\\nHowever, a constructor does have a subroutine body of the usu al form, a block of statements.\\nThere are no restrictions on what statements can be used. And it can have a list of formal\\nparameters. In fact, the ability to include parameters is on e of the main reasons for using\\nconstructors. The parameters can provide data to be used in t he construction of the object.\\nF or example, a constructor for the PairOfDice class could provide the values that are initially\\nshowing on the dice. Here is what the class would look like in t hat case:\\npublic class PairOfDice {\\npublic int die1; // Number showing on the first die.\\npublic int die2; // Number showing on the second die.\\npublic PairOfDice(int val1, int val2) {\\n// Constructor. Creates a pair of dice that\\n// are initially showing the values val1 and val2.\\ndie1 = val1; // Assign specified values\\ndie2 = val2; // to the instance variables.\\n}\\npublic void roll() {\\n// Roll the dice by setting each of the dice to be\\n// a random number between 1 and 6.\\ndie1 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;\\ndie2 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;\\n}\\n} // end class PairOfDice\\nThe constructor is declared as “ public PairOfDice(int val1, int val2) ...”, with no\\nreturn type and with the same name as the name of the class. Thi s is how the Java com-\\npiler recognizes a constructor. The constructor has two par ameters, and values for these\\nparameters must be provided when the constructor is called. F or example, the expression\\n“ new PairOfDice(3,4)” would create a PairOfDice object in which the values of the instance\\nvariables die1 and die2 are initially 3 and 4. Of course, in a program, the value retur ned by\\nthe constructor should be used in some way , as in\\nPairOfDice dice; // Declare a variable of type PairOfDice.\\ndice = new PairOfDice(1,1); // Let dice refer to a new PairOfDice\\n// object that initially shows 1, 1.\\nNow that we’ve added a constructor to the PairOfDice class, we can no longer create\\nan object by saying “ new PairOfDice()”! The system provides a default constructor for a\\nclass only if the class deﬁnition does not already include a constructo r, so there is only one\\nconstructor in the class, and it requires two actual paramet ers. However, this is not a big'),\n",

In\\nfact, you can have as many diﬀerent constructors as you want, as long as their signatures are\\ndiﬀerent, that is, as long as they have diﬀerent numbers or ty pes of formal parameters. In the\\nPairOfDice class, we might have a constructor with no parameters which p roduces a pair of\\ndice showing random numbers:\\npublic class PairOfDice {\\npublic int die1; // Number showing on the first die.\\npublic int die2; // Number showing on the second die.\\npublic PairOfDice() {\\n// Constructor.

None of those programs will ever have to use the obscure incantation\\n“ (int)(Math.random()*6)+1”, because it’s done inside the PairOfDice class. And the pro-\\ngrammer, having once gotten the dice-rolling thing straigh t will never have to worry about it\\nagain. Here, for example, is a main program that uses the PairOfDice class to count how many\\ntimes two pairs of dice are rolled before the two pairs come up showing the same value. This\\nillustrates once again that you can create several instance s of the same class:\\npublic class RollTwoPairs {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nPairOfDice firstDice; // Refers to the first pair of dice.\\nfirstDice = new PairOfDice();\\nPairOfDice secondDice; // Refers to the second pair of dice.\\nsecondDice = new PairOfDice();\\nint countRolls; // Counts how many times the two pairs of\\n// dice have been rolled.\\nint total1; // Total showing on first pair of dice.\\nint total2; // Total showing on second pair of dice.'),\n",

PROGRAMMING WITH OBJECTS 179\\n5.2.3 Garbage Collection\\nSo far, this section has been about creating objects. What ab out destroying them? In Java,\\nthe destruction of objects takes place automatically .\\nAn object exists in the heap, and it can be accessed only throu gh variables that hold\\nreferences to the object. What should be done with an object i f there are no variables that\\nrefer to it? Such things can happen. Consider the following t wo statements (though in reality ,\\nyou’d never do anything like this):\\nStudent std = new Student(\"John Smith\");\\nstd = null;\\nIn the ﬁrst line, a reference to a newly created Student object is stored in the variable std.\\nBut in the next line, the value of std is changed, and the reference to the Student object is\\ngone. In fact, there are now no references whatsoever to that object stored in any variable. So\\nthere is no way for the program ever to use the object again. It might as well not exist. In fact,\\nthe memory occupied by the object should be reclaimed to be us ed for another purpose.\\nJava uses a procedure called garbage collection to reclaim memory occupied by objects\\nthat are no longer accessible to a program. It is the responsi bility of the system, not the\\nprogrammer, to keep track of which objects are “garbage.” In the above example, it was very\\neasy to see that the Student object had become garbage. Usually , it’s much harder. If an\\nobject has been used for a while, there might be several refer ences to the object stored in several\\nvariables. The object doesn’t become garbage until all thos e references have been dropped.\\nIn many other programming languages, it’s the programmer’s responsibility to delete the\\ngarbage. Unfortunately , keeping track of memory usage is ve ry error-prone, and many serious\\nprogram bugs are caused by such errors. A programmer might ac cidently delete an object even\\nthough there are still references to that object. This is cal led a dangling pointer error , and\\nit leads to problems when the program tries to access an objec t that is no longer there. Another\\ntype of error is a memory leak , where a programmer neglects to delete objects that are no\\nlonger in use. This can lead to ﬁlling memory with objects tha t are completely inaccessible,\\nand the program might run out of memory even though, in fact, l arge amounts of memory are\\nbeing wasted.\\nBecause Java uses garbage collection, such errors are simpl y impossible. Garbage collection\\nis an old idea and has been used in some programming languages since the 1960s. Y ou might\\nwonder why all languages don’t use garbage collection. In th e past, it was considered too slow\\nand wasteful. However, research into garbage collection te chniques combined with the incredible\\nspeed of modern computers have combined to make garbage coll ection feasible. Programmers\\nshould rejoice.\\n5.3 Programming with Objects\\nThere are several ways in which object-oriented concepts can be applied to the proc ess\\nof designing and writing programs. The broadest of these is object-oriented analysis and\\ndesign which applies an object-oriented methodology to the earlie st stages of program devel-\\nopment, during which the overall design of a program is creat ed. Here, the idea is to identify\\nthings in the problem domain that can be modeled as objects. O n another level, object-oriented\\nprogramming encourages programmers to produce generalized software components that\\ncan be used in a wide variety of programming projects.'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nOf course, for the most part, you will experience “generaliz ed software components” by\\nusing the standard classes that come along with Java. W e begi n this section by looking at some\\nbuilt-in classes that are used for creating objects. At the e nd of the section, we will get back\\nto generalities.\\n5.3.1 Some Built-in Classes\\nAlthough the focus of object-oriented programming is gener ally on the design and implementa-\\ntion of new classes, it’s important not to forget that the des igners of Java have already provided\\na large number of reusable classes. Some of these classes are meant to be extended to produce\\nnew classes, while others can be used directly to create usef ul objects. A true mastery of Java\\nrequires familiarity with a large number of built-in classe s—something that takes a lot of time\\nand experience to develop. In the next chapter, we will begin the study of Java’s GUI classes,\\nand you will encounter other built-in classes throughout th e remainder of this book. But let’s\\ntake a moment to look at a few built-in classes that you might ﬁ nd useful.\\nA string can be built up from smaller pieces using the + operator, but this is not very eﬃcient.\\nIf str is a String and ch is a character, then executing the command “ str = str + ch;”\\ninvolves creating a whole new string that is a copy of str, with the value of ch appended\\nonto the end. Copying the string takes some time. Building up a long string letter by letter\\nwould require a surprising amount of processing. The class StringBuﬀer makes it possible to be\\neﬃcient about building up a long string from a number of small er pieces. T o do this, you must\\nmake an object belonging to the StringBuﬀer class. F or example:\\nStringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer();\\n(This statement both declares the variable buffer and initializes it to refer to a newly created\\nStringBuﬀer object. Combining declaration with initialization was cov ered in Subsection 4.7.1\\nand works for objects just as it does for primitive types.)\\nLike a String, a StringBuﬀer contains a sequence of characters. However, it is possible t o\\nadd new characters onto the end of a StringBuffer without making a copy of the data that\\nit already contains. If x is a value of any type and buffer is the variable deﬁned above, then\\nthe command buffer.append(x) will add x, converted into a string representation, onto the\\nend of the data that was already in the buﬀer. This command act ually modiﬁes the buﬀer,\\nrather than making a copy , and that can be done eﬃciently . A lo ng string can be built up\\nin a StringBuﬀer using a sequence of append() commands. When the string is complete, the\\nfunction buffer.toString() will return a copy of the string in the buﬀer as an ordinary val ue\\nof type String. The StringBuﬀer class is in the standard package java.lang, so you can use its\\nsimple name without importing it.\\nA number of useful classes are collected in the package java.util. F or example, this package\\ncontains classes for working with collections of objects. W e will study these collection classes in\\nChapter 10. Another class in this package, java.util.Date, is used to represent times. When\\na Date object is constructed without parameters, the result repre sents the current date and\\ntime, so an easy way to display this information is:\\nSystem.out.println( new Date() );\\nOf course, to use the Date class in this way , you must make it available by importing it w ith one\\nof the statements “ import java.util.Date;” or “ import java.util.*;” at the beginning of\\nyour program.

PROGRAMMING WITH OBJECTS 181\\nMath.random() uses one of these objects behind the scenes to generate its ra ndom numbers.\\nAn object of type Random can generate random integers, as well as random real numbers . If\\nrandGen is created with the command:\\nRandom randGen = new Random();\\nand if N is a positive integer, then randGen.nextInt(N) generates a random integer in the range\\nfrom 0 to N-1. F or example, this makes it a little easier to roll a pair of di ce. Instead of say-\\ning “ die1 = (int)(6*Math.random())+1;”, one can say “ die1 = randGen.nextInt(6)+1;”.\\n(Since you also have to import the class java.util.Random and create the Random object, you\\nmight not agree that it is actually easier.) An object of type Random can also be used to generate\\nso-called Gaussian distributed random real numbers.\\nThe main point here, again, is that many problems have alread y been solved, and the\\nsolutions are available in Java’s standard classes. If you a re faced with a task that looks like\\nit should be fairly common, it might be worth looking through a Java reference to see whether\\nsomeone has already written a class that you can use.\\n5.3.2 Wrapper Classes and Autoboxing\\nW e have already encountered the classes Double and Integer in Subsection 2.5.7. These classes\\ncontain the static methods Double.parseDouble and Integer.parseInteger that are used\\nto convert strings to numerical values. W e have also encount ered the Character class in some\\nexamples, and static methods such as Character.isLetter, which can be used to test whether\\na given value of type char is a letter. There is a similar class for each of the other prim itive types,\\nLong, Short, Byte, Float, and Boolean. These classes are called wrapper classes . Although\\nthey contain useful static members, they have another use as well: They are used for crea ting\\nobjects that represent primitive type values.\\nRemember that the primitive types are not classes, and value s of primitive type are not\\nobjects. However, sometimes it’s useful to treat a primitiv e value as if it were an object. Y ou\\ncan’t do that literally , but you can “wrap” the primitive typ e value in an object belonging to\\none of the wrapper classes.\\nF or example, an object of type Double contains a single instance variable, of type double.\\nThe object is a wrapper for the double value. F or example, you can create an object that wraps\\nthe double value 6.0221415e23 with\\nDouble d = new Double(6.0221415e23);\\nThe value of d contains the same information as the value of type double, but it is an object. If\\nyou want to retrieve the double value that is wrapped in the object, you can call the function\\nd.doubleValue(). Similarly , you can wrap an int in an object of type Integer, a boolean value\\nin an object of type Boolean, and so on. (As an example of where this would be useful, the\\ncollection classes that will be studied in Chapter 10 can onl y hold objects. If you want to add\\na primitive type value to a collection, it has to be put into a w rapper object ﬁrst.)\\nIn Java 5.0, wrapper classes have become easier to use. Java 5 .0 introduced automatic\\nconversion between a primitive type and the corresponding w rapper class. F or example, if\\nyou use a value of type int in a context that requires an object of type Integer, the int will\\nautomatically be wrapped in an Integer object. F or example, you can say\\nInteger answer = 42;\\nand the computer will silently read this as if it were'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nInteger answer = new Integer(42);\\nThis is called autoboxing. It works in the other direction, too. F or example, if d refers to an\\nobject of type Double, you can use d in a numerical expression such as 2*d. The double value\\ninside d is automatically unboxed and multiplied by 2. Autoboxing and unboxing also apply\\nto subroutine calls. F or example, you can pass an actual para meter of type int to a subroutine\\nthat has a formal parameter of type Integer. In fact, autoboxing and unboxing make it possible\\nin many circumstances to ignore the diﬀerence between primi tive types and objects.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe wrapper classes contain a few other things that deserve t o be mentioned. Integer, for\\nexample, contains constants Integer.MIN VALUE and Integer.MAX VALUE, which are equal to\\nthe largest and smallest possible values of type int, that is, to -2147483648 and 2147483647\\nrespectively . It’s certainly easier to remember the names t han the numerical values. There are\\nsimilar named constants in Long, Short, and Byte. Double and Float also have constants named\\nMIN VALUE and MAX VALUE. MAX VALUE still gives the largest number that can be represented\\nin the given type, but MIN VALUE represents the smallest possible positive value. F or type\\ndouble, Double.MIN VALUE is 4.9 times 10 −324. Since double values have only a ﬁnite accuracy ,\\nthey can’t get arbitrarily close to zero. This is the closest they can get without actually being\\nequal to zero.\\nThe class Double deserves special mention, since doubles are so much more complicated than\\nintegers. The encoding of real numbers into values of type double has room for a few special val-\\nues that are not real numbers at all in the mathematical sense . These values are given by named\\nconstants in class Double: Double.POSITIVE INFINITY, Double.NEGATIVE INFINITY, and\\nDouble.NaN. The inﬁnite values can occur as the values of certain mathem atical expressions. F or\\nexample, dividing a positive number by zero will give the res ult Double.POSITIVE INFINITY.\\n(It’s even more complicated than this, actually , because th e double type includes a value\\ncalled “negative zero”, written -0.0. Dividing a positive number by negative zero gives\\nDouble.NEGATIVE INFINITY.) Y ou also get Double.POSITIVE INFINITY whenever the mathe-\\nmatical value of an expression is greater than Double.MAX VALUE. F or example, 1e200*1e200\\nis considered to be inﬁnite. The value Double.NaN is even more interesting. “NaN” stands for\\nNot a Number , and it represents an undeﬁned value such as the square root o f a negative\\nnumber or the result of dividing zero by zero. Because of the e xistence of Double.NaN, no math-\\nematical operation on real numbers will ever throw an except ion; it simply gives Double.NaN\\nas the result.\\nY ou can test whether a value, x, of type double is inﬁnite or undeﬁned by calling the\\nboolean-valued static functions Double.isInfinite(x) and Double.isNaN(x). (It’s especially\\nimportant to use Double.isNaN() to test for undeﬁned values, because Double.NaN has re-\\nally weird behavior when used with relational operators suc h as ==. In fact, the values of\\nx == Double.NaN and x != Double.NaN are both false , no matter what the value of x, so\\nyou really can’t use these expressions to test whether x is Double.NaN.)\\n5.3.3 The class “Object”\\nW e have already seen that one of the major features of object- oriented programming is the\\nability to create subclasses of a class. The subclass inheri ts all the properties or behaviors of\\nthe class, but can modify and add to what it inherits. In Secti on 5.5, you’ll learn how to create\\nsubclasses. What you don’t know yet is that every class in Java (with just one exception) is\\na subclass of some other class. If you create a class and don’t explicitly make it a subclass of'),\n",

PROGRAMMING WITH OBJECTS 183\\nsome other class, then it automatically becomes a subclass o f the special class named Object.\\n(Object is the one class that is not a subclass of any other class.)\\nClass Object deﬁnes several instance methods that are inherited by every other class. These\\nmethods can be used with any object whatsoever. I will mentio n just one of them here. Y ou\\nwill encounter more of them later in the book.\\nThe instance method toString() in class Object returns a value of type String that is\\nsupposed to be a string representation of the object. Y ou’ve already used this method implicitly ,\\nany time you’ve printed out an object or concatenated an obje ct onto a string. When you use\\nan object in a context that requires a string, the object is au tomatically converted to type\\nString by calling its toString() method.\\nThe version of toString that is deﬁned in Object just returns the name of the class that\\nthe object belongs to, concatenated with a code number calle d the hash code of the object;\\nthis is not very useful. When you create a class, you can write a new toString() method for\\nit, which will replace the inherited version. F or example, w e might add the following method\\nto any of the PairOfDice classes from the previous section:\\npublic String toString() {\\n// Return a String representation of a pair of dice, where die1\\n// and die2 are instance variables containing the numbers that are\\n// showing on the two dice.\\nif (die1 == die2)\\nreturn \"double \" + die1;\\nelse\\nreturn die1 + \" and \" + die2;\\n}\\nIf dice refers to a PairOfDice object, then dice.toString() will return strings such as\\n“3 and 6”, “5 and 1”, and “double 2”, depending on the numbers s howing on the dice. This\\nmethod would be used automatically to convert dice to type String in a statement such as\\nSystem.out.println( \"The dice came up \" + dice );\\nso this statement might output, “The dice came up 5 and 1” or “T he dice came up double 2”.\\nY ou’ll see another example of a toString() method in the next section.\\n5.3.4 Object-oriented Analysis and Design\\nEvery programmer builds up a stock of techniques and experti se expressed as snippets of code\\nthat can be reused in new programs using the tried-and-true m ethod of cut-and-paste: The old\\ncode is physically copied into the new program and then edite d to customize it as necessary .\\nThe problem is that the editing is error-prone and time-cons uming, and the whole enterprise is\\ndependent on the programmer’s ability to pull out that parti cular piece of code from last year’s\\nproject that looks like it might be made to ﬁt. (On the level of a corporation that wants to\\nsave money by not reinventing the wheel for each new project, just keeping track of all the old\\nwheels becomes a major task.)\\nW ell-designed classes are software components that can be r eused without editing. A well-\\ndesigned class is not carefully crafted to do a particular jo b in a particular program. Instead,\\nit is crafted to model some particular type of object or a sing le coherent concept. Since objects\\nand concepts can recur in many problems, a well-designed cla ss is likely to be reusable without\\nmodiﬁcation in a variety of projects.'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nF urthermore, in an object-oriented programming language, it is possible to make subclasses\\nof an existing class. This makes classes even more reusable. If a class needs to be customized,\\na subclass can be created, and additions or modiﬁcations can be made in the subclass without\\nmaking any changes to the original class. This can be done eve n if the programmer doesn’t\\nhave access to the source code of the class and doesn’t know an y details of its internal, hidden\\nimplementation.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe PairOfDice class in the previous section is already an example of a gener alized software\\ncomponent, although one that could certainly be improved. T he class represents a single,\\ncoherent concept, “a pair of dice.” The instance variables h old the data relevant to the state\\nof the dice, that is, the number showing on each of the dice. Th e instance method represents\\nthe behavior of a pair of dice, that is, the ability to be rolle d. This class would be reusable in\\nmany diﬀerent programming projects.\\nOn the other hand, the Student class from the previous section is not very reusable. It\\nseems to be crafted to represent students in a particular cou rse where the grade will be based\\non three tests. If there are more tests or quizzes or papers, i t’s useless. If there are two people\\nin the class who have the same name, we are in trouble (one reas on why numerical student ID’s\\nare often used). Admittedly , it’s much more diﬃcult to devel op a general-purpose student class\\nthan a general-purpose pair-of-dice class. But this partic ular Student class is good mostly as\\nan example in a programming textbook.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nA large programming project goes through a number of stages, starting with speciﬁcation\\nof the problem to be solved, followed by analysis of the problem and design of a program\\nto solve it. Then comes coding, in which the program’s design is expressed in some actual\\nprogramming language. This is followed by testing and debugging of the program. After that\\ncomes a long period of maintenance, which means ﬁxing any new problems that are found\\nin the program and modifying it to adapt it to changing requir ements. T ogether, these stages\\nform what is called the software life cycle . (In the real world, the ideal of consecutive stages\\nis seldom if ever achieved. During the analysis stage, it mig ht turn out that the speciﬁcations\\nare incomplete or inconsistent. A problem found during test ing requires at least a brief return\\nto the coding stage. If the problem is serious enough, it migh t even require a new design.\\nMaintenance usually involves redoing some of the work from p revious stages. . . .)\\nLarge, complex programming projects are only likely to succ eed if a careful, systematic\\napproach is adopted during all stages of the software life cy cle. The systematic approach to\\nprogramming, using accepted principles of good design, is c alled software engineering . The\\nsoftware engineer tries to eﬃciently construct programs th at veriﬁably meet their speciﬁcations\\nand that are easy to modify if necessary . There is a wide range of “methodologies” that can\\nbe applied to help in the systematic design of programs. (Mos t of these methodologies seem to\\ninvolve drawing little boxes to represent program componen ts, with labeled arrows to represent\\nrelationships among the boxes.)\\nW e have been discussing object orientation in programming l anguages, which is relevant to\\nthe coding stage of program development. But there are also o bject-oriented methodologies for\\nanalysis and design. The question in this stage of the softwa re life cycle is, How can one discover\\nor invent the overall structure of a program? As an example of a rather simple object-oriented\\napproach to analysis and design, consider this advice: W rit e down a description of the problem.\\nUnderline all the nouns in that description. The nouns shoul d be considered as candidates for\\nbecoming classes or objects in the program design. Similarl y , underline all the verbs. These'),\n",

F ur ther analysis might uncover the\\nneed for more classes and methods, and it might reveal that su bclassing can be used to take\\nadvantage of similarities among classes.\\nThis is perhaps a bit simple-minded, but the idea is clear and the general approach can be\\neﬀective: Analyze the problem to discover the concepts that are involved, and create classes to\\nrepresent those concepts. The design should arise from the p roblem itself, and you should end\\nup with a program whose structure reﬂects the structure of th e problem in a natural way .\\n5.4 Programming Example: Card, Hand, Deck\\nIn this section, we look at some speciﬁc examples of object-o riented design in a domain that\\nis simple enough that we have a chance of coming up with someth ing reasonably reusable.\\nConsider card games that are played with a standard deck of pl aying cards (a so-called “poker”\\ndeck, since it is used in the game of poker).\\n5.4.1 Designing the classes\\nIn a typical card game, each player gets a hand of cards. The de ck is shuﬄed and cards are\\ndealt one at a time from the deck and added to the players’ hand s. In some games, cards can\\nbe removed from a hand, and new cards can be added. The game is w on or lost depending\\non the value (ace, 2, . . . , king) and suit (spades, diamonds, c lubs, hearts) of the cards that a\\nplayer receives. If we look for nouns in this description, th ere are several candidates for objects:\\ngame, player, hand, card, deck, value, and suit. Of these, th e value and the suit of a card are\\nsimple values, and they will just be represented as instance variables in a Card object. In a\\ncomplete program, the other ﬁve nouns might be represented b y classes. But let’s work on the\\nones that are most obviously reusable: card, hand, and deck.\\nIf we look for verbs in the description of a card game, we see th at we can shuﬄe a deck and\\ndeal a card from a deck. This gives use us two candidates for in stance methods in a Deck class:\\nshuffle() and dealCard(). Cards can be added to and removed from hands. This gives two\\ncandidates for instance methods in a Hand class: addCard() and removeCard(). Cards are\\nrelatively passive things, but we need to be able to determin e their suits and values. W e will\\ndiscover more instance methods as we go along.\\nFirst, we’ll design the deck class in detail. When a deck of ca rds is ﬁrst created, it contains\\n52 cards in some standard order. The Deck class will need a constructor to create a new deck.\\nThe constructor needs no parameters because any new deck is t he same as any other. There will\\nbe an instance method called shuffle() that will rearrange the 52 cards into a random order.\\nThe dealCard() instance method will get the next card from the deck. This wil l be a function\\nwith a return type of Card, since the caller needs to know what card is being dealt. It ha s no\\nparameters—when you deal the next card from the deck, you don ’t provide any information to\\nthe deck; you just get the next card, whatever it is. What will happen if there are no more\\ncards in the deck when its dealCard() method is called? It should probably be considered an\\nerror to try to deal a card from an empty deck, so the deck can th row an exception in that case.\\nBut this raises another question: How will the rest of the pro gram know whether the deck is\\nempty? Of course, the program could keep track of how many car ds it has used. But the deck\\nitself should know how many cards it has left, so the program s hould just be able to ask the\\ndeck object. W e can make this possible by specifying another instance method, cardsLeft(),\\nthat returns the number of cards remaining in the deck. This l eads to a full speciﬁcation of all'),\n",

This function returns the\\n// number of cards that are still left in the deck.\\npublic Card dealCard()\\n// Deals one card from the deck and returns it.\\n// Throws an exception if no more cards are left.\\nThis is everything you need to know in order to use the Deck class. Of course, it doesn’t tell\\nus how to write the class. This has been an exercise in design, not in programming. In fact,\\nwriting the class involves a programming technique, arrays , which will not be covered until\\nChapter 7. Nevertheless, you can look at the source code, Deck.java, if you want. Even though\\nyou won’t understand the implementation, the Javadoc comme nts give you all the information\\nthat you need to understand the interface. With this informa tion, you can use the class in your\\nprograms without understanding the implementation.\\nW e can do a similar analysis for the Hand class. When a hand object is ﬁrst created, it\\nhas no cards in it. An addCard() instance method will add a card to the hand. This method\\nneeds a parameter of type Card to specify which card is being added. F or the removeCard()\\nmethod, a parameter is needed to specify which card to remove . But should we specify the\\ncard itself (“Remove the ace of spades”), or should we specif y the card by its position in the\\nhand (“Remove the third card in the hand”)? Actually , we don’ t have to decide, since we can\\nallow for both options. W e’ll have two removeCard() instance methods, one with a parameter\\nof type Card specifying the card to be removed and one with a parameter of t ype int specifying\\nthe position of the card in the hand. (Remember that you can ha ve two methods in a class with\\nthe same name, provided they have diﬀerent types of paramete rs.) Since a hand can contain\\na variable number of cards, it’s convenient to be able to ask a hand object how many cards it\\ncontains. So, we need an instance method getCardCount() that returns the number of cards\\nin the hand. When I play cards, I like to arrange the cards in my hand so that cards of the\\nsame value are next to each other. Since this is a generally us eful thing to be able to do, we\\ncan provide instance methods for sorting the cards in the han d.

But given the source code,\\nHand.java, you can use the class in your own programming projects.\\n5.4.2 The Card Class\\nW e have covered enough material to write a Card class. The class will have a constructor\\nthat speciﬁes the value and suit of the card that is being crea ted. There are four suits, which\\ncan be represented by the integers 0, 1, 2, and 3. It would be to ugh to remember which\\nnumber represents which suit, so I’ve deﬁned named constant s in the Card class to represent\\nthe four possibilities. F or example, Card.SPADES is a constant that represents the suit, spades.\\n(These constants are declared to be public final static ints. It might be better to use\\nan enumerated type, but for now we will stick to integer-valu ed constants. I’ll return to the\\nquestion of using enumerated types in this example at the end of the chapter.) The possible\\nvalues of a card are the numbers 1, 2, . . . , 13, with 1 standing f or an ace, 11 for a jack, 12 for\\na queen, and 13 for a king. Again, I’ve deﬁned some named const ants to represent the values\\nof aces and face cards. (When you read the Card class, you’ll see that I’ve also added support\\nfor Jokers.)\\nA Card object can be constructed knowing the value and the suit of th e card. F or example,\\nwe can call the constructor with statements such as:\\ncard1 = new Card( Card.ACE, Card.SPADES ); // Construct ace o f spades.\\ncard2 = new Card( 10, Card.DIAMONDS ); // Construct 10 of diam onds.\\ncard3 = new Card( v, s ); // This is OK, as long as v and s\\n// are integer expressions.'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nA Card object needs instance variables to represent its value and s uit. I’ve made these\\nprivate so that they cannot be changed from outside the class, and I’v e provided getter methods\\ngetSuit() and getValue() so that it will be possible to discover the suit and value from outside\\nthe class. The instance variables are initialized in the con structor, and are never changed after\\nthat. In fact, I’ve declared the instance variables suit and value to be final, since they are\\nnever changed after they are initialized. (An instance vari able can be declared final provided\\nit is either given an initial value in its declaration or is in itialized in every constructor in the\\nclass.)\\nFinally , I’ve added a few convenience methods to the class to make it easier to print out\\ncards in a human-readable form. F or example, I want to be able to print out the suit of a\\ncard as the word “Diamonds”, rather than as the meaningless c ode number 2, which is used\\nin the class to represent diamonds. Since this is something t hat I’ll probably have to do in\\nmany programs, it makes sense to include support for it in the class. So, I’ve provided instance\\nmethods getSuitAsString() and getValueAsString() to return string representations of the\\nsuit and value of a card. Finally , I’ve deﬁned the instance me thod toString() to return a\\nstring with both the value and suit, such as “Queen of Hearts” . Recall that this method will be\\nused whenever a Card needs to be converted into a String, such as when the card is concatenated\\nonto a string with the + operator. Thus, the statement\\nSystem.out.println( \"Your card is the \" + card );\\nis equivalent to\\nSystem.out.println( \"Your card is the \" + card.toString() );\\nIf the card is the queen of hearts, either of these will print o ut “Y our card is the Queen of\\nHearts”.\\nHere is the complete Card class.

A deck of cards is\\nshuﬄed, and one card is dealt from the deck and shown to the use r. The user predicts whether\\nthe next card from the deck will be higher or lower than the cur rent card. If the user predicts\\ncorrectly , then the next card from the deck becomes the curre nt card, and the user makes\\nanother prediction. This continues until the user makes an i ncorrect prediction. The number\\nof correct predictions is the user’s score.\\nMy program has a subroutine that plays one game of HighLow. Th is subroutine has a\\nreturn value that represents the user’s score in the game. Th e main() routine lets the user play\\nseveral games of HighLow. At the end, it reports the user’s av erage score.\\nI won’t go through the development of the algorithms used in t his program, but I encourage\\nyou to read it carefully and make sure that you understand how it works. Note in particular\\nthat the subroutine that plays one game of HighLow returns th e user’s score in the game as its\\nreturn value. This gets the score back to the main program, wh ere it is needed.

This is a powerful idea. However , something like this can be done\\nin most programming languages. The central new idea in objec t-oriented programming—the\\nidea that really distinguishes it from traditional program ming—is to allow classes to express\\nthe similarities among objects that share some, but not all, of their structure and behavior.\\nSuch similarities can be expressed using inheritance and polymorphism.\\n5.5.1 Extending Existing Classes\\nThe topics covered later in this section are relatively adva nced aspects of object-oriented pro-\\ngramming. Any programmer should know what is meant by subcla ss, inheritance, and polymor-\\nphism. However, it will probably be a while before you actual ly do anything with inheritance\\nexcept for extending classes that already exist. In the ﬁrst part of this section, we look at how\\nthat is done.\\nIn day-to-day programming, especially for programmers who are just beginning to work\\nwith objects, subclassing is used mainly in one situation: T here is an existing class that can be\\nadapted with a few changes or additions. This is much more com mon than designing groups of\\nclasses and subclasses from scratch. The existing class can be extended to make a subclass.\\nThe syntax for this is\\npublic class ⟨subclass-name ⟩ extends ⟨existing-class-name ⟩ {\\n.\\n. // Changes and additions.\\n.\\n}\\nAs an example, suppose you want to write a program that plays t he card game, Blackjack.\\nY ou can use the Card, Hand, and Deck classes developed in Section 5.4. However, a hand in the\\ngame of Blackjack is a little diﬀerent from a hand of cards in g eneral, since it must be possible\\nto compute the “value” of a Blackjack hand according to the ru les of the game. The rules are\\nas follows: The value of a hand is obtained by adding up the val ues of the cards in the hand.\\nThe value of a numeric card such as a three or a ten is its numeri cal value. The value of a Jack,\\nQueen, or King is 10. The value of an Ace can be either 1 or 11. An Ace should be counted\\nas 11 unless doing so would put the total value of the hand over 21. Note that this means that\\nthe second, third, or fourth Ace in the hand will always be cou nted as 1.\\nOne way to handle this is to extend the existing Hand class by adding a method that\\ncomputes the Blackjack value of the hand. Here’s the deﬁniti on of such a class:'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nExtending existing classes is an easy way to build on previou s work. W e’ll see that many\\nstandard classes have been written speciﬁcally to be used as the basis for making subclasses.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nAccess modiﬁers such as public and private are used to control access to members of a\\nclass. There is one more access modiﬁer, protected, that comes into the picture when subclasses\\nare taken into consideration. When protected is applied as an access modiﬁer to a method or\\nmember variable in a class, that member can be used in subclas ses—direcct or indirect—of the\\nclass in which it is deﬁned, but it cannot be used in non-subcl asses. (There is one exception:\\nA protected member can also be accessed by any class in the same package as the class that\\ncontains the protected member. Recall that using no access m odiﬁer makes a member accessible\\nto classes in the same package, and nowhere else. Using the protected modiﬁer is strictly more\\nliberal than using no modiﬁer at all: It allows access from cl asses in the same package and from\\nsubclasses that are not in the same package.)\\nWhen you declare a method or member variable to be protected, you are saying that it\\nis part of the implementation of the class, rather than part o f the public interface of the class.\\nHowever, you are allowing subclasses to use and modify that p art of the implementation.\\nF or example, consider a PairOfDice class that has instance variables die1 and die2 to\\nrepresent the numbers appearing on the two dice. W e could mak e those variables private to\\nmake it impossible to change their values from outside the cl ass, while still allowing read access\\nthrough getter methods. However, if we think it possible tha t PairOfDice will be used to create\\nsubclasses, we might want to make it possible for subclasses to change the numbers on the dice.\\nF or example, a GraphicalDice subclass that draws the dice might want to change the numbers\\nat other times besides when the dice are rolled. In that case, we could make die1 and die2\\nprotected, which would allow the subclass to change their values witho ut making them public\\nto the rest of the world. (An even better idea would be to deﬁne protected setter methods for\\nthe variables. A setter method could, for example, ensure th at the value that is being assigned\\nto the variable is in the legal range 1 through 6.)\\n5.5.2 Inheritance and Class Hierarchy\\nThe term inheritance refers to the fact that one class can inherit part or all of its structure\\nand behavior from another class. The class that does the inhe riting is said to be a subclass of\\nthe class from which it inherits. If class B is a subclass of cl ass A, we also say that class A is a\\nsuperclass of class B. (Sometimes the terms derived class and base class are used instead\\nof subclass and superclass; this is the common terminology i n C++.) A subclass can add to the\\nstructure and behavior that it inherits. It can also replace or modify inherited behavior (though\\nnot inherited structure). The relationship between subcla ss and superclass is sometimes shown\\nby a diagram in which the subclass is shown below, and connect ed to, its superclass, as shown\\nhere on the left.'),\n",

INHERIT ANCE AND POL YMORPHISM 197\\nIn Java, to create a class named “B” as a subclass of a class nam ed “A”, you would write\\nclass B extends A {\\n.\\n. // additions to, and modifications of,\\n. // stuff inherited from class A\\n.\\n}\\nSeveral classes can be declared as subclasses of the same sup erclass. The subclasses, which\\nmight be referred to as “sibling classes,” share some struct ures and behaviors—namely , the ones\\nthey inherit from their common superclass. The superclass e xpresses these shared structures\\nand behaviors. In the diagram shown on the right, above, clas ses B, C, and D are sibling classes.\\nInheritance can also extend over several “generations” of c lasses. This is shown in the diagram,\\nwhere class E is a subclass of class D which is itself a subclas s of class A. In this case, class E\\nis considered to be a subclass of class A, even though it is not a direct subclass. This whole set\\nof classes forms a small class hierarchy .\\n5.5.3 Example: Vehicles\\nLet’s look at an example. Suppose that a program has to deal wi th motor vehicles, including\\ncars, trucks, and motorcycles. (This might be a program used by a Department of Motor\\nV ehicles to keep track of registrations.) The program could use a class named Vehicle to\\nrepresent all types of vehicles. Since cars, trucks, and mot orcycles are types of vehicles, they\\nwould be represented by subclasses of the Vehicle class, as shown in this class hierarchy diagram:\\nThe Vehicle class would include instance variables such as registrationNumber and owner and\\ninstance methods such as transferOwnership(). These are variables and methods common\\nto all vehicles. The three subclasses of Vehicle— Car, T ruck, and Motorcycle—could then be\\nused to hold variables and methods speciﬁc to particular typ es of vehicles. The Car class\\nmight add an instance variable numberOfDoors, the T ruck class might have numberOfAxles,'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nand the Motorcycle class could have a boolean variable hasSidecar. (W ell, it could in theory\\nat least, even if it might give a chuckle to the people at the De partment of Motor V ehicles.)\\nThe declarations of these classes in a Java program would loo k, in outline, like this (although\\nin practice, they would probably be public classes, deﬁned in separate ﬁles):\\nclass Vehicle {\\nint registrationNumber;\\nPerson owner; // (Assuming that a Person class has been defin ed!)\\nvoid transferOwnership(Person newOwner) {\\n. . .\\n}\\n. . .\\n}\\nclass Car extends Vehicle {\\nint numberOfDoors;\\n. . .\\n}\\nclass Truck extends Vehicle {\\nint numberOfAxles;\\n. . .\\n}\\nclass Motorcycle extends Vehicle {\\nboolean hasSidecar;\\n. . .\\n}\\nSuppose that myCar is a variable of type Car that has been declared and initialized with the\\nstatement\\nCar myCar = new Car();\\nGiven this declaration, a program could refer to myCar.numberOfDoors, since numberOfDoors\\nis an instance variable in the class Car. But since class Car extends class Vehicle, a car also\\nhas all the structure and behavior of a vehicle. This means th at myCar.registrationNumber,\\nmyCar.owner, and myCar.transferOwnership() also exist.\\nNow, in the real world, cars, trucks, and motorcycles are in f act vehicles. The same is true\\nin a program. That is, an object of type Car or T ruck or Motorcycle is automatically an object\\nof type Vehicle too. This brings us to the following Important F act:\\nA variable that can hold a reference\\nto an object of class A can also hold a reference\\nto an object belonging to any subclass of A.\\nThe practical eﬀect of this in our example is that an object of type Car can be assigned to a\\nvariable of type Vehicle.

The object “remembers” that it is in fact\\na Car, and not just a Vehicle. Information about the actual class of an object is stored as part\\nof that object. It is even possible to test whether a given obj ect belongs to a given class, using\\nthe instanceof operator. The test:\\nif (myVehicle instanceof Car) ...\\ndetermines whether the object referred to by myVehicle is in fact a car.\\nOn the other hand, the assignment statement\\nmyCar = myVehicle;\\nwould be illegal because myVehicle could potentially refer to other types of vehicles that are\\nnot cars. This is similar to a problem we saw previously in Sub section 2.5.6: The computer\\nwill not allow you to assign an int value to a variable of type short, because not every int is a\\nshort. Similarly , it will not allow you to assign a value of type Vehicle to a variable of type Car\\nbecause not every vehicle is a car. As in the case of ints and shorts, the solution here is to use\\ntype-casting. If, for some reason, you happen to know that myVehicle does in fact refer to a\\nCar, you can use the type cast (Car)myVehicle to tell the computer to treat myVehicle as if\\nit were actually of type Car. So, you could say\\nmyCar = (Car)myVehicle;\\nand you could even refer to ((Car)myVehicle).numberOfDoors. As an example of how this\\ncould be used in a program, suppose that you want to print out r elevant data about a vehicle.\\nY ou could say:\\nSystem.out.println(\"Vehicle Data:\");\\nSystem.out.println(\"Registration number: \"\\n+ myVehicle.registrationNumber);\\nif (myVehicle instanceof Car) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Type of vehicle: Car\");\\nCar c;\\nc = (Car)myVehicle;\\nSystem.out.println(\"Number of doors: \" + c.numberOfDoors );\\n}\\nelse if (myVehicle instanceof Truck) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Type of vehicle: Truck\");\\nTruck t;\\nt = (Truck)myVehicle;\\nSystem.out.println(\"Number of axles: \" + t.numberOfAxles );\\n}\\nelse if (myVehicle instanceof Motorcycle) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Type of vehicle: Motorcycle\");\\nMotorcycle m;\\nm = (Motorcycle)myVehicle;\\nSystem.out.println(\"Has a sidecar: \" + m.hasSidecar);\\n}\\nNote that for object types, when the computer executes a prog ram, it checks whether\\ntype-casts are valid. So, for example, if myVehicle refers to an object of type Truck, then\\nthe type cast (Car)myVehicle would be an error. When this happes, an exception of type\\nClassCastException is thrown.'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\n5.5.4 Polymorphism\\nAs another example, consider a program that deals with shape s drawn on the screen. Let’s say\\nthat the shapes include rectangles, ovals, and roundrects o f various colors. (A “roundrect” is\\njust a rectangle with rounded corners.)\\nThree classes, Rectangle, Oval, and RoundRect, could be used to represent the three types of\\nshapes. These three classes would have a common superclass, Shape, to represent features that\\nall three shapes have in common. The Shape class could include instance variables to represent\\nthe color, position, and size of a shape, and it could include instance methods for changing the\\ncolor, position, and size. Changing the color, for example, might involve changing the value of\\nan instance variable, and then redrawing the shape in its new color:\\nclass Shape {\\nColor color; // Color of the shape. (Recall that class Color\\n// is defined in package java.awt. Assume\\n// that this class has been imported.)\\nvoid setColor(Color newColor) {\\n// Method to change the color of the shape.\\ncolor = newColor; // change value of instance variable\\nredraw(); // redraw shape, which will appear in new color\\n}\\nvoid redraw() {\\n// method for drawing the shape\\n? ? ? // what commands should go here?\\n}\\n. . . // more instance variables and methods\\n} // end of class Shape\\nNow, you might see a problem here with the method redraw(). The problem is that each\\ndiﬀerent type of shape is drawn diﬀerently . The method setColor() can be called for any type\\nof shape. How does the computer know which shape to draw when i t executes the redraw()?\\nInformally , we can answer the question like this: The comput er executes redraw() by asking\\nthe shape to redraw itself. Every shape object knows what it has to do to redraw itself.\\nIn practice, this means that each of the speciﬁc shape classe s has its own redraw() method:\\nclass Rectangle extends Shape {\\nvoid redraw() {\\n. . . // commands for drawing a rectangle'),\n",

As a program executes, and the value of oneShape changes, it\\ncould even refer to objects of diﬀerent types at diﬀerent tim es! Whenever the statement\\noneShape.redraw();\\nis executed, the redraw method that is actually called is the one appropriate for the type of\\nobject to which oneShape actually refers. There may be no way of telling, from looking at the\\ntext of the program, what shape this statement will draw, sin ce it depends on the value that\\noneShape happens to have when the program is executed. Even more is tru e. Suppose the\\nstatement is in a loop and gets executed many times. If the val ue of oneShape changes as the\\nloop is executed, it is possible that the very same statement “ oneShape.redraw();” will call\\ndiﬀerent methods and draw diﬀerent shapes as it is executed o ver and over. W e say that the\\nredraw() method is polymorphic. A method is polymorphic if the action performed by the\\nmethod depends on the actual type of the object to which the me thod is applied. Polymorphism\\nis one of the major distinguishing features of object-orien ted programming.\\nPerhaps this becomes more understandable if we change our te rminology a bit: In object-\\noriented programming, calling a method is often referred to as sending a message to an object.\\nThe object responds to the message by executing the appropri ate method. The statement\\n“ oneShape.redraw();” is a message to the object referred to by oneShape. Since that object\\nknows what type of object it is, it knows how it should respond to the message. F rom this point\\nof view, the computer always executes “ oneShape.redraw();” in the same way: by sending\\na message. The response to the message depends, naturally , o n who receives it. F rom this\\npoint of view, objects are active entities that send and rece ive messages, and polymorphism is\\na natural, even necessary , part of this view. Polymorphism j ust means that diﬀerent objects\\ncan respond to the same message in diﬀerent ways.\\nOne of the most beautiful things about polymorphism is that i t lets code that you write do\\nthings that you didn’t even conceive of, at the time you wrote it. Suppose that I decide to add\\nbeveled rectangles to the types of shapes my program can deal with. A beveled rectangle has\\na triangle cut oﬀ each corner:'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nT o implement beveled rectangles, I can write a new subclass, BeveledRect, of class Shape\\nand give it its own redraw() method. Automatically , code that I wrote previously—such a s\\nthe statement oneShape.redraw()—can now suddenly start drawing beveled rectangles, even\\nthough the beveled rectangle class didn’t exist when I wrote the statement!\\nIn the statement “ oneShape.redraw();”, the redraw message is sent to the object\\noneShape. Look back at the method from the Shape class for changing the color of a shape:\\nvoid setColor(Color newColor) {\\ncolor = newColor; // change value of instance variable\\nredraw(); // redraw shape, which will appear in new color\\n}\\nA redraw message is sent here, but which object is it sent to? W ell, the setColor method\\nis itself a message that was sent to some object. The answer is that the redraw message is sent\\nto that same object, the one that received the setColor message. If that object is a rectangle,\\nthen it is the redraw() method from the Rectangle class that is executed. If the object is an\\noval, then it is the redraw() method from the Oval class. This is what you should expect, but\\nit means that the “ redraw();” statement in the setColor() method does not necessarily call\\nthe redraw() method in the Shape class! The redraw() method that is executed could be in\\nany subclass of Shape.\\nAgain, this is not a real surprise if you think about it in the r ight way . Remember that\\nan instance method is always contained in an object. The clas s only contains the source code\\nfor the method. When a Rectangle object is created, it contains a redraw() method. The\\nsource code for that method is in the Rectangle class. The object also contains a setColor()\\nmethod. Since the Rectangle class does not deﬁne a setColor() method, the source code for\\nthe rectangle’s setColor() method comes from the superclass, Shape, but the method itself\\nis in the object of type Rectangle. Even though the source codes for the two methods are in\\ndiﬀerent classes, the methods themselves are part of the sam e object. When the rectangle’s\\nsetColor() method is executed and calls redraw(), the redraw() method that is executed is\\nthe one in the same object.\\n5.5.5 Abstract Classes\\nWhenever a Rectangle, Oval, or RoundRect object has to draw itself, it is the redraw() method in\\nthe appropriate class that is executed. This leaves open the question, What does the redraw()\\nmethod in the Shape class do? How should it be deﬁned?\\nThe answer may be surprising: W e should leave it blank! The fa ct is that the class Shape\\nrepresents the abstract idea of a shape, and there is no way to draw such a thing. Only\\nparticular, concrete shapes like rectangles and ovals can b e drawn. So, why should there'),\n",

INHERIT ANCE AND POL YMORPHISM 203\\neven be a redraw() method in the Shape class? W ell, it has to be there, or it would be\\nillegal to call it in the setColor() method of the Shape class, and it would be illegal to write\\n“ oneShape.redraw();”, where oneShape is a variable of type Shape. The compiler would\\ncomplain that oneShape is a variable of type Shape and there’s no redraw() method in the\\nShape class.\\nNevertheless the version of redraw() in the Shape class itself will never actually be called.\\nIn fact, if you think about it, there can never be any reason to construct an actual object of\\ntype Shape ! Y ou can have variables of type Shape, but the objects they refer to will always\\nbelong to one of the subclasses of Shape. W e say that Shape is an abstract class . An abstract\\nclass is one that is not used to construct objects, but only as a basis for making subclasses. An\\nabstract class exists only to express the common properties of all its subclasses. A cla ss that\\nis not abstract is said to be concrete. Y ou can create objects belonging to a concrete class,\\nbut not to an abstract class. A variable whose type is given by an abstract class can only refer\\nto objects that belong to concrete subclasses of the abstrac t class.\\nSimilarly , we say that the redraw() method in class Shape is an abstract method , since\\nit is never meant to be called. In fact, there is nothing for it to do—any actual redrawing is\\ndone by redraw() methods in the subclasses of Shape. The redraw() method in Shape has\\nto be there. But it is there only to tell the computer that all Shapes understand the redraw\\nmessage. As an abstract method, it exists merely to specify t he common interface of all the\\nactual, concrete versions of redraw() in the subclasses of Shape. There is no reason for the\\nabstract redraw() in class Shape to contain any code at all.\\nShape and its redraw() method are semantically abstract. Y ou can also tell the comp uter,\\nsyntactically , that they are abstract by adding the modiﬁer “ abstract” to their deﬁnitions.\\nF or an abstract method, the block of code that gives the imple mentation of an ordinary method\\nis replaced by a semicolon. An implementation must be provid ed for the abstract method in\\nany concrete subclass of the abstract class. Here’s what the Shape class would look like as an\\nabstract class:\\npublic abstract class Shape {\\nColor color; // color of shape.\\nvoid setColor(Color newColor) {\\n// method to change the color of the shape\\ncolor = newColor; // change value of instance variable\\nredraw(); // redraw shape, which will appear in new color\\n}\\nabstract void redraw();\\n// abstract method---must be defined in\\n// concrete subclasses\\n. . . // more instance variables and methods\\n} // end of class Shape\\nOnce you have declared the class to be abstract, it becomes illegal to try to create actual\\nobjects of type Shape, and the computer will report a syntax error if you try to do so .\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nRecall from Subsection 5.3.3 that a class that is not explici tly declared to be a subclass of\\nsome other class is automatically made a subclass of the stan dard class Object.

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\npublic class myClass { . . .\\nis exactly equivalent to\\npublic class myClass extends Object { . . .\\nThis means that class Object is at the top of a huge class hierarchy that includes every\\nother class. (Semantially , Object is an abstract class, in fact the most abstract class of all.\\nCuriously , however, it is not declared to be abstract syntactially , which means that you can\\ncreate objects of type Object. What you would do with them, however, I have no idea.)\\nSince every class is a subclass of Object, a variable of type Object can refer to any object\\nwhatsoever, of any type. Java has several standard data stru ctures that are designed to hold\\nObjects, but since every object is an instance of class Object, these data structures can actually\\nhold any object whatsoever. One example is the “ArrayList” d ata structure, which is deﬁned by\\nthe class ArrayList in the package java.util. ( ArrayList is discussed more fully in Section 7.3.)\\nAn ArrayList is simply a list of Objects. This class is very convenient, because an ArrayList can\\nhold any number of objects, and it will grow, when necessary , as objects are added to it. Since\\nthe items in the list are of type Object, the list can actually hold objects of any type.\\nA program that wants to keep track of various Shape s that have been drawn on the screen\\ncan store those shapes in an ArrayList. Suppose that the ArrayList is named listOfShapes.\\nA shape, oneShape, can be added to the end of the list by calling the instance met hod\\n“ listOfShapes.add(oneShape);”. The shape can be removed from the list with the instance\\nmethod “ listOfShapes.remove(oneShape);”. The number of shapes in the list is given by\\nthe function “ listOfShapes.size()”. And it is possible to retrieve the i-th object from the\\nlist with the function call “ listOfShapes.get(i)”. (Items in the list are numbered from 0 to\\nlistOfShapes.size() - 1.) However, note that this method returns an Object, not a Shape.\\n(Of course, the people who wrote the ArrayList class didn’t even know about Shapes, so the\\nmethod they wrote could hardly have a return type of Shape !) Since you know that the items\\nin the list are, in fact, Shape s and not just Objects, you can type-cast the Object returned by\\nlistOfShapes.get(i) to be a value of type Shape :\\noneShape = (Shape)listOfShapes.get(i);\\nLet’s say , for example, that you want to redraw all the shapes in the list. Y ou could do\\nthis with a simple for loop, which is lovely example of object-oriented programmi ng and of\\npolymorphism:\\nfor (int i = 0; i < listOfShapes.size(); i++) {\\nShape s; // i-th element of the list, considered as a Shape\\ns = (Shape)listOfShapes.get(i);\\ns.redraw(); // What is drawn here depends on what type of shap e s is!\\n}\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe sample source code ﬁle ShapeDraw.java uses an abstract Shape class and an ArrayList\\nto hold a list of shapes. The ﬁle deﬁnes an applet in which the u ser can add various shapes to\\na drawing area. Once a shape is in the drawing area, the user ca n use the mouse to drag it\\naround.\\nY ou might want to look at this ﬁle, even though you won’t be abl e to understand all of it\\nat this time. Even the deﬁnitions of the shape classes are som ewhat diﬀerent from those that\\nI have described in this section. (F or example, the draw() method has a parameter of type\\nGraphics. This parameter is required because of the way Java handles a ll drawing.) I’ll return'),\n",

However, it\\nwould still be worthwhile to look at the deﬁnition of the Shape class and its subclasses in the\\nsource code. Y ou might also check how an ArrayList is used to hold the list of shapes.\\nIn the applet the only time when the actual class of a shape is u sed is when that shape is\\nadded to the screen. Once the shape has been created, it is man ipulated entirely as an abstract\\nshape. The routine that implements dragging, for example, w orks only with variables of type\\nShape. As the Shape is being dragged, the dragging routine just calls the Shape’s draw method\\neach time the shape has to be drawn, so it doesn’t have to know h ow to draw the shape or even\\nwhat type of shape it is.

And unfortu nately , beyond the basic ideas\\nthere are a lot of details. This section and the next cover mor e of those annoying details. Y ou\\nshould not necessarily master everything in these two secti ons the ﬁrst time through, but you\\nshould read it to be aware of what is possible. F or the most par t, when I need to use this\\nmaterial later in the text, I will explain it again brieﬂy , or I will refer you back to it. In this\\nsection, we’ll look at two variables, this and super, that are automatically deﬁned in any\\ninstance method.\\n5.6.1 The Special Variable this\\nA static member of a class has a simple name, which can only be u sed inside the class deﬁ-\\nnition. F or use outside the class, it has a full name of the for m ⟨class-name⟩.⟨simple-name⟩.\\nF or example, “ System.out” is a static member variable with simple name “ out” in the class\\n“ System”. It’s always legal to use the full name of a static member, ev en within the class\\nwhere it’s deﬁned. Sometimes it’s even necessary , as when th e simple name of a static member\\nvariable is hidden by a local variable of the same name.\\nInstance variables and instance methods also have simple na mes. The simple name of such\\nan instance member can be used in instance methods in the clas s where the instance member\\nis deﬁned. Instance members also have full names, but rememb er that instance variables and\\nmethods are actually contained in objects, not classes. The full name of an instance member\\nhas to contain a reference to the object that contains the ins tance member. T o get at an\\ninstance variable or method from outside the class deﬁnitio n, you need a variable that refers to\\nthe object. Then the full name is of the form ⟨variable-name⟩.⟨simple-name⟩. But suppose you\\nare writing the deﬁnition of an instance method in some class . How can you get a reference to\\nthe object that contains that instance method? Y ou might nee d such a reference, for example,\\nif you want to use the full name of an instance variable, becau se the simple name of the instance\\nvariable is hidden by a local variable or parameter.\\nJava provides a special, predeﬁned variable named “ this” that you can use for such pur-\\nposes. The variable, this, is used in the source code of an instance method to refer to th e'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nobject that contains the method. This intent of the name, this, is to refer to “this object,” the\\none right here that this very method is in. If x is an instance variable in the same object, then\\nthis.x can be used as a full name for that variable. If otherMethod() is an instance method\\nin the same object, then this.otherMethod() could be used to call that method. Whenever\\nthe computer executes an instance method, it automatically sets the variable, this, to refer to\\nthe object that contains the method.\\nOne common use of this is in constructors. F or example:\\npublic class Student {\\nprivate String name; // Name of the student.\\npublic Student(String name) {\\n// Constructor. Create a student with specified name.\\nthis.name = name;\\n}\\n.\\n. // More variables and methods.\\n.\\n}\\nIn the constructor, the instance variable called name is hidden by a formal parameter. How-\\never, the instance variable can still be referred to by its fu ll name, this.name. In the assign-\\nment statement, the value of the formal parameter, name, is assigned to the instance variable,\\nthis.name. This is considered to be acceptable style: There is no need t o dream up cute new\\nnames for formal parameters that are just used to initialize instance variables. Y ou can use the\\nsame name for the parameter as for the instance variable.\\nThere are other uses for this. Sometimes, when you are writing an instance method, you\\nneed to pass the object that contains the method to a subrouti ne, as an actual parameter. In\\nthat case, you can use this as the actual parameter. F or example, if you wanted to print o ut\\na string representation of the object, you could say “ System.out.println(this);”. Or you\\ncould assign the value of this to another variable in an assignment statement. In fact, you can\\ndo anything with this that you could do with any other variable, except change its v alue.\\n5.6.2 The Special Variable super\\nJava also deﬁnes another special variable, named “ super”, for use in the deﬁnitions of instance\\nmethods. The variable super is for use in a subclass. Like this, super refers to the object\\nthat contains the method. But it’s forgetful. It forgets tha t the object belongs to the class you\\nare writing, and it remembers only that it belongs to the supe rclass of that class. The point is\\nthat the class can contain additions and modiﬁcations to the superclass. super doesn’t know\\nabout any of those additions and modiﬁcations; it can only be used to refer to methods and\\nvariables in the superclass.\\nLet’s say that the class that you are writing contains an inst ance method named\\ndoSomething(). Consider the subroutine call statement super.doSomething(). Now, super\\ndoesn’t know anything about the doSomething() method in the subclass. It only knows\\nabout things in the superclass, so it tries to execute a metho d named doSomething() from\\nthe superclass. If there is none—if the doSomething() method was an addition rather than a\\nmodiﬁcation—you’ll get a syntax error.\\nThe reason super exists is so you can get access to things in the superclass tha t are hidden\\nby things in the subclass. F or example, super.x always refers to an instance variable named'),\n",

THIS AND SUPER 207\\nx in the superclass. This can be useful for the following reaso n: If a class contains an instance\\nvariable with the same name as an instance variable in its sup erclass, then an object of that\\nclass will actually contain two variables with the same name : one deﬁned as part of the class\\nitself and one deﬁned as part of the superclass. The variable in the subclass does not replace\\nthe variable of the same name in the superclass; it merely hides it. The variable from the\\nsuperclass can still be accessed, using super.\\nWhen you write a method in a subclass that has the same signatu re as a method in its\\nsuperclass, the method from the superclass is hidden in the s ame way . W e say that the method\\nin the subclass overrides the method from the superclass. Again, however, super can be used\\nto access the method from the superclass.\\nThe major use of super is to override a method with a new method that extends the\\nbehavior of the inherited method, instead of replacing that behavior entirely . The new method\\ncan use super to call the method from the superclass, and then it can add add itional code to\\nprovide additional behavior. As an example, suppose you hav e a PairOfDice class that includes\\na roll() method. Suppose that you want a subclass, GraphicalDice, to represent a pair of\\ndice drawn on the computer screen. The roll() method in the GraphicalDice class should do\\neverything that the roll() method in the PairOfDice class does. W e can express this with a\\ncall to super.roll(), which calls the method in the superclass. But in addition to that, the\\nroll() method for a GraphicalDice object has to redraw the dice to show the new values. The\\nGraphicalDice class might look something like this:\\npublic class GraphicalDice extends PairOfDice {\\npublic void roll() {\\n// Roll the dice, and redraw them.\\nsuper.roll(); // Call the roll method from PairOfDice.\\nredraw(); // Call a method to draw the dice.\\n}\\n.\\n. // More stuff, including definition of redraw().\\n.\\n}\\nNote that this allows you to extend the behavior of the roll() method even if you don’t know\\nhow the method is implemented in the superclass!\\nHere is a more complete example. The applet at the end of Secti on 4.7 in the on-line\\nversion of this book shows a disturbance that moves around in a mosaic of little squares. As it\\nmoves, each square it visits become a brighter shade of red. T he result looks interesting, but I\\nthink it would be prettier if the pattern were symmetric. A sy mmetric version of the applet is\\nshown at the bottom of the Section 5.7 (in the on-line version ). The symmetric applet can be\\nprogrammed as an easy extension of the original applet.\\nIn the symmetric version, each time a square is brightened, t he squares that can be obtained\\nfrom that one by horizontal and vertical reﬂection through t he center of the mosaic are also\\nbrightened. This picture might make the symmetry idea clear er:'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nThe four red squares in the picture, for example, form a set of such symmetrically placed\\nsquares, as do the purple squares and the green squares. (The blue square is at the center of\\nthe mosaic, so reﬂecting it doesn’t produce any other square s; it’s its own reﬂection.)\\nThe original applet is deﬁned by the class RandomBrighten. In that class, the actual task\\nof brightening a square is done by a method called brighten(). If row and col are the row\\nand column numbers of a square, then “ brighten(row,col);” increases the brightness of that\\nsquare. All we need is a subclass of RandomBrighten with a modiﬁed brighten() routine.\\nInstead of just brightening one square, the modiﬁed routine will also brighten the horizontal\\nand vertical reﬂections of that square. But how will it brigh ten each of the four individual\\nsquares? By calling the brighten() method from the original class. It can do this by calling\\nsuper.brighten().\\nThere is still the problem of computing the row and column num bers of the horizontal\\nand vertical reﬂections. T o do this, you need to know the numb er of rows and the number\\nof columns. The RandomBrighten class has instance variables named ROWS and COLUMNS to\\nrepresent these quantities. Using these variables, it’s po ssible to come up with formulas for the\\nreﬂections, as shown in the deﬁnition of the brighten() method below.\\nHere’s the complete deﬁnition of the new class:\\npublic class SymmetricBrighten extends RandomBrighten {\\nvoid brighten(int row, int col) {\\n// Brighten the specified square and its horizontal\\n// and vertical reflections. This overrides the brighten\\n// method from the RandomBrighten class, which just\\n// brightens one square.\\nsuper.brighten(row, col);\\nsuper.brighten(ROWS - 1 - row, col);\\nsuper.brighten(row, COLUMNS - 1 - col);\\nsuper.brighten(ROWS - 1 - row, COLUMNS - 1 - col);\\n}\\n} // end class SymmetricBrighten\\nThis is the entire source code for the applet!\\n5.6.3 Constructors in Subclasses\\nConstructors are not inherited. That is, if you extend an exi sting class to make a subclass, the\\nconstructors in the superclass do not become part of the subclass. If you want constructors in\\nthe subclass, you have to deﬁne new ones from scratch.

It looks like you might have to repeat all tha t work in the subclass! This could\\nbe a real problem if you don’t have the source code to the superclass, a nd don’t know how\\nit works, or if the constructor in the superclass initialize s private member variables that you\\ndon’t even have access to in the subclass!\\nObviously , there has to be some ﬁx for this, and there is. It in volves the special variable,\\nsuper. As the very ﬁrst statement in a constructor, you can use super to call a constructor\\nfrom the superclass. The notation for this is a bit ugly and mi sleading, and it can only be used\\nin this one particular circumstance: It looks like you are ca lling super as a subroutine (even\\nthough super is not a subroutine and you can’t call constructors the same w ay you call other\\nsubroutines anyway). As an example, assume that the PairOfDice class has a constructor that\\ntakes two integers as parameters. Consider a subclass:\\npublic class GraphicalDice extends PairOfDice {\\npublic GraphicalDice() { // Constructor for this class.\\nsuper(3,4); // Call the constructor from the\\n// PairOfDice class, with parameters 3, 4.\\ninitializeGraphics(); // Do some initialization specific\\n// to the GraphicalDice class.\\n}\\n.\\n. // More constructors, methods, variables...\\n.\\n}\\nThe statement “ super(3,4);” calls the constructor from the superclass. This call must\\nbe the ﬁrst line of the constructor in the subclass. Note that if you don’t explicitly call a\\nconstructor from the superclass in this way , then the defaul t constructor from the superclass,\\nthe one with no parameters, will be called automatically .\\nThis might seem rather technical, but unfortunately it is so metimes necessary . By the way ,\\nyou can use the special variable this in exactly the same way to call another constructor in the\\nsame class. This can be useful since it can save you from repea ting the same code in several\\nconstructors.\\n5.7 Interfaces, Nested Classes, and Other Details\\nTHIS SECTION simply pulls together a few more miscellaneous f eatures of object oriented\\nprogramming in Java. Read it now, or just look through it and r efer back to it later when you\\nneed this material.

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nSuch multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java. The designers of Java wanted to keep the\\nlanguage reasonably simple, and felt that the beneﬁts of mul tiple inheritance were not worth the\\ncost in increased complexity . However, Java does have a feat ure that can be used to accomplish\\nmany of the same goals as multiple inheritance: interfaces.\\nW e’ve encountered the term “interface” before, in connecti on with black boxes in general and\\nsubroutines in particular. The interface of a subroutine co nsists of the name of the subroutine,\\nits return type, and the number and types of its parameters. T his is the information you need\\nto know if you want to call the subroutine. A subroutine also h as an implementation: the block\\nof code which deﬁnes it and which is executed when the subrout ine is called.\\nIn Java, interface is a reserved word with an additional, technical meaning. An\\n“ interface” in this sense consists of a set of instance method interface s, without any as-\\nsociated implementations. (Actually , a Java interface can contain other things as well, but we\\nwon’t discuss them here.) A class can implement an interface by providing an implemen-\\ntation for each of the methods speciﬁed by the interface. Her e is an example of a very simple\\nJava interface:\\npublic interface Drawable {\\npublic void draw(Graphics g);\\n}\\nThis looks much like a class deﬁnition, except that the imple mentation of the draw() method is\\nomitted. A class that implements the interface Drawable must provide an implementation for\\nthis method. Of course, the class can also include other meth ods and variables. F or example,\\npublic class Line implements Drawable {\\npublic void draw(Graphics g) {\\n. . . // do something---presumably, draw a line\\n}\\n. . . // other methods and variables\\n}\\nNote that to implement an interface, a class must do more than simply provide an implementa-\\ntion for each method in the interface; it must also state that it implements the interface, using\\nthe reserved word implements as in this example: “public class Line implements Drawable”.\\nAny class that implements the Drawable interface deﬁnes a draw() instance method. Any ob-\\nject created from such a class includes a draw() method. W e say that an object implements'),\n",

INTERF ACES, NESTED CLASSES, AND OTHER DET AILS 211\\nan interface if it belongs to a class that implements the interface. F or ex ample, any object\\nof type Line implements the Drawable interface.\\nWhile a class can extend only one other class, it can implement any number of interfaces.\\nIn fact, a class can both extend one other class and implement one or more interfaces. So, we\\ncan have things like\\nclass FilledCircle extends Circle\\nimplements Drawable, Fillable {\\n. . .\\n}\\nThe point of all this is that, although interfaces are not cla sses, they are something very\\nsimilar. An interface is very much like an abstract class, th at is, a class that can never be used\\nfor constructing objects, but can be used as a basis for makin g subclasses. The subroutines\\nin an interface are abstract methods, which must be implemen ted in any concrete class that\\nimplements the interface. And as with abstract classes, eve n though you can’t construct an\\nobject from an interface, you can declare a variable whose ty pe is given by the interface. F or\\nexample, if Drawable is an interface, and if Line and FilledCircle are classes that implement\\nDrawable, then you could say:\\nDrawable figure; // Declare a variable of type Drawable. It c an\\n// refer to any object that implements the\\n// Drawable interface.\\nfigure = new Line(); // figure now refers to an object of class Line\\nfigure.draw(g); // calls draw() method from class Line\\nfigure = new FilledCircle(); // Now, figure refers to an obje ct\\n// of class FilledCircle.\\nfigure.draw(g); // calls draw() method from class FilledCi rcle\\nA variable of type Drawable can refer to any object of any class that implements the Drawable\\ninterface. A statement like figure.draw(g), above, is legal because figure is of type Drawable,\\nand any Drawable object has a draw() method. So, whatever object figure refers to, that\\nobject must have a draw() method.\\nNote that a type is something that can be used to declare variables. A type can also be\\nused to specify the type of a parameter in a subroutine, or the return type of a function. In\\nJava, a type can be either a class, an interface, or one of the e ight built-in primitive types.\\nThese are the only possibilities. Of these, however, only cl asses can be used to construct new\\nobjects.\\nY ou are not likely to need to write your own interfaces until y ou get to the point of writing\\nfairly complex programs. However, there are a few interface s that are used in important ways\\nin Java’s standard packages. Y ou’ll learn about some of thes e standard interfaces in the next\\nfew chapters.\\n5.7.2 Nested Classes\\nA class seems like it should be a pretty important thing. A cla ss is a high-level building block\\nof a program, representing a potentially complex idea and it s associated data and behaviors.\\nI’ve always felt a bit silly writing tiny little classes that exist only to group a few scraps of data\\ntogether. However, such trivial classes are often useful an d even essential. F ortunately , in Java,\\nI can ease the embarrassment, because one class can be nested inside another class. My trivial'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nlittle class doesn’t have to stand on its own. It becomes part of a larger more respectable class.\\nThis is particularly useful when you want to create a little c lass speciﬁcally to support the work\\nof a larger class. And, more seriously , there are other good r easons for nesting the deﬁnition of\\none class inside another class.\\nIn Java, a nested class is any class whose deﬁnition is inside the deﬁnition of anoth er\\nclass. Nested classes can be either named or anonymous. I will come back to the topic of\\nanonymous classes later in this section. A named nested clas s, like most other things that occur\\nin classes, can be either static or non-static.\\nThe deﬁnition of a static nested class looks just like the deﬁ nition of any other class, except\\nthat it is nested inside another class and it has the modiﬁer static as part of its declaration.\\nA static nested class is part of the static structure of the co ntaining class. It can be used inside\\nthat class to create objects in the usual way . If it has not bee n declared private, then it can\\nalso be used outside the containing class, but when it is used outside the class, its name must\\nindicate its membership in the containing class. This is sim ilar to other static components of\\na class: A static nested class is part of the class itself in th e same way that static member\\nvariables are parts of the class itself.\\nF or example, suppose a class named WireFrameModel represents a set of lines in three-\\ndimensional space. (Such models are used to represent three -dimensional objects in graphics\\nprograms.) Suppose that the WireFrameModel class contains a static nested class, Line, that\\nrepresents a single line. Then, outside of the class WireFrameModel, the Line class would be\\nreferred to as WireFrameModel.Line. Of course, this just follows the normal naming convention\\nfor static members of a class. The deﬁnition of the WireFrameModel class with its nested Line\\nclass would look, in outline, like this:\\npublic class WireFrameModel {\\n. . . // other members of the WireFrameModel class\\nstatic public class Line {\\n// Represents a line from the point (x1,y1,z1)\\n// to the point (x2,y2,z2) in 3-dimensional space.\\ndouble x1, y1, z1;\\ndouble x2, y2, z2;\\n} // end class Line\\n. . . // other members of the WireFrameModel class\\n} // end WireFrameModel\\nInside the WireFrameModel class, a Line object would be created with the constructor “ new\\nLine()”. Outside the class, “ new WireFrameModel.Line()” would be used.\\nA static nested class has full access to the static members of the containing class, even to the\\nprivate members. Similarly , the containing class has full a ccess to the members of the nested\\nclass. This can be another motivation for declaring a nested class, since it lets you give one\\nclass access to the private members of another class without making those members generally\\navailable to other classes.\\nWhen you compile the above class deﬁnition, two class ﬁles wi ll be created. Even though\\nthe deﬁnition of Line is nested inside WireFrameModel, the compiled Line class is stored in a\\nseparate ﬁle. The name of the class ﬁle for Line will be WireFrameModel$Line.class.\\n∗ ∗ ∗'),\n",

INTERF ACES, NESTED CLASSES, AND OTHER DET AILS 213\\nNon-static nested classes are referred to as inner classes . Inner classes are not, in practice,\\nvery diﬀerent from static nested classes, but a non-static n ested class is actually associated with\\nan object rather than to the class in which it is nested. This c an take some getting used to.\\nAny non-static member of a class is not really part of the clas s itself (although its source\\ncode is contained in the class deﬁnition). This is true for in ner classes, just as it is for any other\\nnon-static part of a class. The non-static members of a class specify what will be contained in\\nobjects that are created from that class. The same is true—at least logically—for inner classes.\\nIt’s as if each object that belongs to the containing class ha s its own copy of the nested class.\\nThis copy has access to all the instance methods and instance variables of the object, even to\\nthose that are declared private. The two copies of the inner class in two diﬀerent objects diﬀ er\\nbecause the instance variables and methods they refer to are in diﬀerent objects. In fact, the\\nrule for deciding whether a nested class should be static or n on-static is simple: If the nested\\nclass needs to use any instance variable or instance method f rom the containing class, make the\\nnested class non-static. Otherwise, it might as well be stat ic.\\nF rom outside the containing class, a non-static nested clas s has to be referred to using a\\nname of the form ⟨variableName⟩.⟨NestedClassName⟩, where ⟨variableName⟩ is a variable that\\nrefers to the object that contains the class. This is actuall y rather rare, however. A non-static\\nnested class is generally used only inside the class in which it is nested, and there it can be\\nreferred to by its simple name.\\nIn order to create an object that belongs to an inner class, yo u must ﬁrst have an object\\nthat belongs to the containing class. (When working inside t he class, the object “ this” is used\\nimplicitly .) The inner class object is permanently associa ted with the containing class object,\\nand it has complete access to the members of the containing cl ass object. Looking at an example\\nwill help, and will hopefully convince you that inner classe s are really very natural. Consider\\na class that represents poker games. This class might includ e a nested class to represent the\\nplayers of the game. This structure of the PokerGame class could be:\\npublic class PokerGame { // Represents a game of poker.\\nprivate class Player { // Represents one of the players in thi s game.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n} // end class Player\\nprivate Deck deck; // A deck of cards for playing the game.\\nprivate int pot; // The amount of money that has been bet.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n} // end class PokerGame\\nIf game is a variable of type PokerGame, then, conceptually , game contains its own copy of\\nthe Player class. In an an instance method of a PokerGame object, a new Player object would\\nbe created by saying “ new Player()”, just as for any other class. (A Player object could be\\ncreated outside the PokerGame class with an expression such as “ game.new Player()”. Again,\\nhowever, this is very rare.) The Player object will have access to the deck and pot instance\\nvariables in the PokerGame object. Each PokerGame object has its own deck and pot and\\nPlayers. Players of that poker game use the deck and pot for that game; players of another\\npoker game use the other game’s deck and pot. That’s the eﬀect of making the Player class'),\n",

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nnon-static. This is the most natural way for players to behav e. A Player object represents a\\nplayer of one particular poker game. If Player were a static nested class, on the other hand, it\\nwould represent the general idea of a poker player, independ ent of a particular poker game.\\n5.7.3 Anonymous Inner Classes\\nIn some cases, you might ﬁnd yourself writing an inner class a nd then using that class in just a\\nsingle line of your program. Is it worth creating such a class ? Indeed, it can be, but for cases\\nlike this you have the option of using an anonymous inner class . An anonymous class is\\ncreated with a variation of the new operator that has the form\\nnew ⟨superclass-or-interface ⟩ ( ⟨parameter-list ⟩ ) {\\n⟨methods-and-variables ⟩\\n}\\nThis constructor deﬁnes a new class, without giving it a name , and it simultaneously creates\\nan object that belongs to that class. This form of the new operator can be used in any statement\\nwhere a regular “ new” could be used. The intention of this expression is to create : “a new object\\nbelonging to a class that is the same as ⟨superclass-or-interface⟩ but with these ⟨methods-and-\\nvariables⟩ added.” The eﬀect is to create a uniquely customized object, just at the point in\\nthe program where you need it. Note that it is possible to base an anonymous class on an\\ninterface, rather than a class. In this case, the anonymous c lass must implement the interface\\nby deﬁning all the methods that are declared in the interface . If an interface is used as a base,\\nthe ⟨parameter-list⟩ must be empty . Otherwise, it can contain parameters for a con structor in\\nthe ⟨superclass⟩.\\nAnonymous classes are often used for handling events in grap hical user interfaces, and we\\nwill encounter them several times in the chapters on GUI prog ramming. F or now, we will look\\nat one not-very-plausible example. Consider the Drawable interface, which is deﬁned earlier in\\nthis section. Suppose that we want a Drawable object that draws a ﬁlled, red, 100-pixel square.\\nRather than deﬁning a new, separate class and then using that class to create the object, we\\ncan use an anonymous class to create the object in one stateme nt:\\nDrawable redSquare = new Drawable() {\\nvoid draw(Graphics g) {\\ng.setColor(Color.red);\\ng.fillRect(10,10,100,100);\\n}\\n};\\nThe semicolon at the end of this statement is not part of the cl ass deﬁnition. It’s the semicolon\\nthat is required at the end of every declaration statement.\\nWhen a Java class is compiled, each anonymous nested class wi ll produce a separate\\nclass ﬁle. If the name of the main class is MainClass, for example, then the names of the\\nclass ﬁles for the anonymous nested classes will be MainClass$1.class, MainClass$2.class,\\nMainClass$3.class, and so on.\\n5.7.4 Mixing Static and Non-static\\nClasses, as I’ve said, have two very distinct purposes. A cla ss can be used to group together a\\nset of static member variables and static member subroutine s. Or it can be used as a factory\\nfor making objects. The non-static variables and subroutin es in the class deﬁnition specify the'),\n",

In most cases , a class performs one or the other\\nof these roles, not both.\\nSometimes, however, static and non-static members are mixe d in a single class. In this case,\\nthe class plays a dual role. Sometimes, these roles are compl etely separate. It is also possible\\nfor the static and non-static parts of a class to interact. Th is happens when instance methods\\nuse static member variables or call static member subroutin es. An instance method belongs to\\nan object, not to the class itself, and there can be many objec ts with their own versions of the\\ninstance method. But there is only one copy of a static member variable. So, eﬀectively , we\\nhave many objects sharing that one variable.\\nSuppose, for example, that we want to write a PairOfDice class that uses the Random class\\nmentioned in Section 5.3 for rolling the dice. T o do this, a PairOfDice object needs access to\\nan object of type Random. But there is no need for each PairOfDice object to have a separate\\nRandom object. (In fact, it would not even be a good idea: Because of t he way random number\\ngenerators work, a program should, in general, use only one s ource of random numbers.) A\\nnice solution is to have a single Random variable as a static member of the PairOfDice class,\\nso that it can be shared by all PairOfDice objects. F or example:\\nimport java.util.Random;\\npublic class PairOfDice {\\nprivate static Random randGen = new Random();\\npublic int die1; // Number showing on the first die.\\npublic int die2; // Number showing on the second die.\\npublic PairOfDice() {\\n// Constructor. Creates a pair of dice that\\n// initially shows random values.\\nroll();\\n}\\npublic void roll() {\\n// Roll the dice by setting each of the dice to be\\n// a random number between 1 and 6.\\ndie1 = randGen.nextInt(6) + 1;\\ndie2 = randGen.nextInt(6) + 1;\\n}\\n} // end class PairOfDice\\nAs another example, let’s rewrite the Student class that was used in Section 5.2. I’ve added\\nan ID for each student and a static member called nextUniqueID. Although there is an ID\\nvariable in each student object, there is only one nextUniqueID variable.\\npublic class Student {\\nprivate String name; // Student’s name.\\nprivate int ID; // Unique ID number for this student.\\npublic double test1, test2, test3; // Grades on three tests.\\nprivate static int nextUniqueID = 0;\\n// keep track of next available unique ID number\\nStudent(String theName) {\\n// Constructor for Student objects; provides a name for the Student,'),\n",

When the very ﬁrst Student\\nobject is created, nextUniqueID becomes 1. When the second object is created, nextUniqueID\\nbecomes 2. After the third object, it becomes 3. And so on. The constructor stores the new\\nvalue of nextUniqueID in the ID variable of the object that is being created. Of course, ID is an\\ninstance variable, so every object has its own individual ID variable. The class is constructed\\nso that each student will automatically get a diﬀerent value for its ID variable. F urthermore,\\nthe ID variable is private, so there is no way for this variable to be tampered with after the\\nobject has been created.

All you have to do is say import java.awt.Color or import java.awt.*.\\nBut you still have to use compound names to refer to static mem ber variables such as\\nSystem.out and to static methods such as Math.sqrt.\\nJava 5.0 introduced a new form of the import directive that can be used to import static\\nmembers of a class in the same way that the ordinary import directive imports classes from a\\npackage. The new form of the directive is called a static import , and it has syntax\\nimport static ⟨package-name ⟩.⟨class-name ⟩.⟨static-member-name ⟩;\\nto import one static member name from a class, or\\nimport static ⟨package-name ⟩.⟨class-name ⟩.*;\\nto import all the public static members from a class.

This means\\nyou can use out.println instead of System.out.println. If you are going to work extensively\\nwith the Math class, you can preface your class deﬁnition with\\nimport static java.lang.Math.*;\\nThis would allow you to say sqrt instead of Math.sqrt, log instead of Math.log, PI instead\\nof Math.PI, and so on.\\nNote that the static import directive requires a ⟨package-name⟩, even for classes in the\\nstandard package java.lang. One consequence of this is that you can’t do a static import f rom\\na class in the default package. In particular, it is not possi ble to do a static import from my\\nT extIO class—if you wanted to do that, you would have to move T extIO into a package.\\n5.7.6 Enums as Classes\\nEnumerated types were introduced in Subsection 2.3.3. Now t hat we have covered more material\\non classes and objects, we can revisit the topic (although st ill not covering enumerated types\\nin their full complexity).\\nEnumerated types are actually classes, and each enumerated type constant is a public,\\nfinal, static member variable in that class (even though they are not decla red with these\\nmodiﬁers). The value of the variable is an object belonging t o the enumerated type class. There\\nis one such object for each enumerated type constant, and the se are the only objects of the\\nclass that can ever be created. It is really these objects tha t represent the possible values of\\nthe enumerated type. The enumerated type constants are actu ally variables that refer to these\\nobjects.\\nWhen an enumerated type is deﬁned inside another class, it is a nested class inside the\\nenclosing class. In fact, it is a static nested class, whethe r you declare it to be static or not.\\nBut it can also be declared as a non-nested class, in a ﬁle of it s own. F or example, we could\\ndeﬁne the following enumerated type in a ﬁle named Suit.java:\\npublic enum Suit {\\nSPADES, HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS\\n}\\nThis enumerated type represents the four possible suits for a playing card, and it could have\\nbeen used in the example Card.java from Subsection 5.4.2.\\nF urthermore, in addition to its list of values, an enumerate d type can contain some of\\nthe other things that a regular class can contain, including methods and additional member\\nvariables. Just add a semicolon (;) at the end of the list of va lues, and then add deﬁnitions\\nof the methods and variables in the usual way . F or example, we might make an enumerated\\ntype to represent the possible values of a playing card. It mi ght be useful to have a method\\nthat returns the corresponding value in the game of Blackjac k. As another example, suppose\\nthat when we print out one of the values, we’d like to see somet hing diﬀerent from the default\\nstring representation (the identiﬁer that names the consta nt). In that case, we can override the\\ntoString() method in the class to print out a diﬀerent string representa tion. This would gives\\nsomething like:\\npublic enum CardValue {'),\n",

A common programming task is computing statistics of a set of numbers. (A statistic is\\na number that summarizes some property of a set of data.) Comm on statistics include\\nthe mean (also known as the average) and the standard deviati on (which tells how spread\\nout the data are from the mean). I have written a little class c alled StatCalc that can\\nbe used to compute these statistics, as well as the sum of the i tems in the dataset and\\nthe number of items in the dataset. Y ou can read the source cod e for this class in the\\nﬁle StatCalc.java. If calc is a variable of type StatCalc, then the following methods are\\ndeﬁned:\\n• calc.enter(item); where item is a number, adds the item to the dataset.\\n• calc.getCount() is a function that returns the number of items that have been\\nadded to the dataset.\\n• calc.getSum() is a function that returns the sum of all the items that have be en\\nadded to the dataset.\\n• calc.getMean() is a function that returns the average of all the items.\\n• calc.getStandardDeviation() is a function that returns the standard deviation\\nof the items.\\nTypically , all the data are added one after the other by calli ng the enter() method\\nover and over, as the data become available. After all the dat a have been entered, any\\nof the other methods can be called to get statistical informa tion about the data. The\\nmethods getMean() and getStandardDeviation() should only be called if the number\\nof items is greater than zero.\\nModify the current source code, StatCalc.java, to add instance methods getMax() and\\ngetMin(). The getMax() method should return the largest of all the items that have be en\\nadded to the dataset, and getMin() should return the smallest.

The instance methods in the Hand class are discussed in that section. In addition\\nto those methods, BlackjackHand includes an instance method, getBlackjackValue(),\\nthat returns the value of the hand for the game of Blackjack. F or this exercise, you will\\nalso need the Deck and Card classes from Section 5.4.\\nA Blackjack hand typically contains from two to six cards. W r ite a program to test the\\nBlackjackHand class. Y ou should create a BlackjackHand object and a Deck object. Pick\\na random number between 2 and 6. Deal that many cards from the d eck and add them to\\nthe hand. Print out all the cards in the hand, and then print ou t the value computed for\\nthe hand by getBlackjackValue(). Repeat this as long as the user wants to continue.\\nIn addition to TextIO.java, your program will depend on Card.java, Deck.java,\\nHand.java, and BlackjackHand.java.\\n5. W rite a program that lets the user play Blackjack. The game wi ll be a simpliﬁed version\\nof Blackjack as it is played in a casino. The computer will act as the dealer. As in\\nthe previous exercise, your program will need the classes de ﬁned in Card.java, Deck.java,\\nHand.java, and BlackjackHand.java. (This is the longest and most complex program that\\nhas come up so far in the exercises.)\\nY ou should ﬁrst write a subroutine in which the user plays one game. The subroutine\\nshould return a boolean value to indicate whether the user wins the game or not. Retur n\\ntrue if the user wins, false if the dealer wins. The program needs an object of class\\nDeck and two objects of type BlackjackHand, one for the dealer and one for the user.\\nThe general object in Blackjack is to get a hand of cards whose value is as close to 21 as\\npossible, without going over. The game goes like this.\\n• First, two cards are dealt into each player’s hand. If the dea ler’s hand has a value of\\n21 at this point, then the dealer wins. Otherwise, if the user has 21, then the user\\nwins. (This is called a “Blackjack”.) Note that the dealer wi ns on a tie, so if both\\nplayers have Blackjack, then the dealer wins.\\n• Now, if the game has not ended, the user gets a chance to add som e cards to her\\nhand. In this phase, the user sees her own cards and sees one of the dealer’s two\\ncards.

Java can be used to write GUI programs rangi ng from simple applets which\\nrun on a W eb page to sophisticated stand-alone applications .\\nGUI programs diﬀer from traditional “straight-through” pr ograms that you have encoun-\\ntered in the ﬁrst few chapters of this book. One big diﬀerence is that GUI programs are\\nevent-driven. That is, user actions such as clicking on a button or pressin g a key on the\\nkeyboard generate events, and the program must respond to th ese events as they occur. Event-\\ndriven programming builds on all the skills you have learned in the ﬁrst ﬁve chapters of this\\ntext. Y ou need to be able to write the subroutines that respon d to events. Inside these subrou-\\ntines, you are doing the kind of programming-in-the-small t hat was covered in Chapter 2 and\\nChapter 3.\\nAnd of course, objects are everywhere in GUI programming. Ev ents are objects. Colors\\nand fonts are objects. GUI components such as buttons and men us are objects. Events are\\nhandled by instance methods contained in objects. In Java, G UI programming is object-oriented\\nprogramming.\\nThis chapter covers the basics of GUI programming. The discu ssion will continue in Chap-\\nter 12 with more details and with more advanced techniques.\\n6.1 The Basic GUI Application\\nThere are two basic types of GUI program in Java: stand-alone applications and\\napplets. An applet is a program that runs in a rectangular area on a W eb page. Applets are\\ngenerally small programs, meant to do fairly simple things, although there is nothing to stop\\nthem from being very complex. Applets were responsible for a lot of the initial excitement about\\nJava when it was introduced, since they could do things that c ould not otherwise be done on\\nW eb pages. However, there are now easier ways to do many of the more basic things that can\\nbe done with applets, and they are no longer the main focus of i nterest in Java. Nevertheless,\\nthere are still some things that can be done best with applets , and they are still fairly common\\non the W eb. W e will look at applets in the next section.\\nA stand-alone application is a program that runs on its own, w ithout depending on a\\nW eb browser. Y ou’ve been writing stand-alone applications all along. Any class that has a\\nmain() routine deﬁnes a stand-alone application; running the prog ram just means executing\\nthis main() routine. However, the programs that you’ve seen up till now h ave been “command-\\nline” programs, where the user and computer interact by typi ng things back and forth to each\\n225'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nother. A GUI program oﬀers a much richer type of user interfac e, where the user uses a mouse\\nand keyboard to interact with GUI components such as windows , menus, buttons, check boxes,\\ntext input boxes, scroll bars, and so on. The main routine of a GUI program creates one or\\nmore such components and displays them on the computer scree n. V ery often, that’s all it does.\\nOnce a GUI component has been created, it follows its own programming—programming that\\ntells it how to draw itself on the screen and how to respond to e vents such as being clicked on\\nby the user.\\nA GUI program doesn’t have to be immensely complex. W e can, fo r example, write a very\\nsimple GUI “Hello W orld” program that says “Hello” to the use r, but does it by opening a\\nwindow where the the greeting is displayed:\\nimport javax.swing.JOptionPane;\\npublic class HelloWorldGUI1 {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nJOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null, \"Hello World!\" );\\n}\\n}\\nWhen this program is run, a window appears on the screen that c ontains the message\\n“Hello W orld!”. The window also contains an “OK” button for t he user to click after reading\\nthe message. When the user clicks this button, the window clo ses and the program ends. By\\nthe way , this program can be placed in a ﬁle named HelloWorldGUI1.java, compiled, and run\\njust like any other Java program.\\nNow, this program is already doing some pretty fancy stuﬀ. It creates a window, it draws\\nthe contents of that window, and it handles the event that is g enerated when the user clicks\\nthe button. The reason the program was so easy to write is that all the work is done by\\nshowMessageDialog(), a static method in the built-in class JOptionPane. (Note that the\\nsource code “imports” the class javax.swing.JOptionPane to make it possible to refer to the\\nJOptionPane class using its simple name. See Subsection 4.5.3 for inform ation about importing\\nclasses from Java’s standard packages.)\\nIf you want to display a message to the user in a GUI program, th is is a good way to do it:\\nJust use a standard class that already knows how to do the work ! And in fact, JOptionPane is\\nregularly used for just this purpose (but as part of a larger p rogram, usually). Of course, if you\\nwant to do anything serious in a GUI program, there is a lot mor e to learn. T o give you an idea\\nof the types of things that are involved, we’ll look at a short GUI program that does the same\\nthings as the previous program—open a window containing a me ssage and an OK button, and\\nrespond to a click on the button by ending the program—but doe s it all by hand instead of by\\nusing the built-in JOptionPane class. Mind you, this is not a good way to write the program,\\nbut it will illustrate some important aspects of GUI program ming in Java.\\nHere is the source code for the program.

One of the most fundamental types of component i s the window . Windows have\\nmany behaviors. They can be opened and closed. They can be res ized. They have “titles” that\\nare displayed in the title bar above the window. And most impo rtant, they can contain other\\nGUI components such as buttons and menus.\\nJava, of course, has a built-in class to represent windows. T here are actually several diﬀerent\\ntypes of window, but the most common type is represented by th e JFrame class (which is\\nincluded in the package javax.swing). A JFrame is an independent window that can, for\\nexample, act as the main window of an application. One of the m ost important things to\\nunderstand is that a JFrame object comes with many of the behaviors of windows already\\nprogrammed in. In particular, it comes with the basic proper ties shared by all windows, such\\nas a titlebar and the ability to be opened and closed. Since a JFrame comes with these behaviors,\\nyou don’t have to program them yourself ! This is, of course, o ne of the central ideas of object-\\noriented programming. What a JFrame doesn’t come with, of course, is content, the stuﬀ that\\nis contained in the window. If you don’t add any other content to a JFrame, it will just display\\na large blank area. Y ou can add content either by creating a JFrame object and then adding\\nthe content to it or by creating a subclass of JFrame and adding the content in the constructor\\nof that subclass.'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nThe main program above declares a variable, window, of type JFrame and sets it to refer to\\na new window object with the statement:\\nJFrame window = new JFrame(\"GUI Test\");\\nThe parameter in the constructor, “GUI T est”, speciﬁes the t itle that will be displayed in the\\ntitlebar of the window. This line creates the window object, but the window itself is not yet\\nvisible on the screen. Before making the window visible, som e of its properties are set with\\nthese statements:\\nwindow.setContentPane(content);\\nwindow.setSize(250,100);\\nwindow.setLocation(100,100);\\nThe ﬁrst line here sets the content of the window. (The conten t itself was created earlier in the\\nmain program.) The second line says that the window will be 25 0 pixels wide and 100 pixels\\nhigh. The third line says that the upper left corner of the win dow will be 100 pixels over from\\nthe left edge of the screen and 100 pixels down from the top. On ce all this has been set up, the\\nwindow is actually made visible on the screen with the comman d:\\nwindow.setVisible(true);\\nIt might look as if the program ends at that point, and, in fact , the main() routine does end.\\nHowever, the the window is still on the screen and the program as a whole does not end until\\nthe user clicks the OK button.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe content that is displayed in a JFrame is called its content pane . (In addition to its\\ncontent pane, a JFrame can also have a menu bar, which is a separate thing that I will t alk\\nabout later.) A basic JFrame already has a blank content pane; you can either add things\\nto that pane or you can replace the basic content pane entirel y . In my sample program,\\nthe line window.setContentPane(content) replaces the original blank content pane with a\\ndiﬀerent component. (Remember that a “component” is just a v isual element of a graphical\\nuser interface). In this case, the new content is a component of type JPanel.\\nJPanel is another of the fundamental classes in Swing. The basic JPanel is, again, just\\na blank rectangle. There are two ways to make a useful JPanel: The ﬁrst is to add other\\ncomponents to the panel; the second is to draw something in the panel. Both of these\\ntechniques are illustrated in the sample program. In fact, y ou will ﬁnd two JPanels in the\\nprogram: content, which is used to contain other components, and displayPanel, which is\\nused as a drawing surface.\\nLet’s look more closely at displayPanel. This variable is of type HelloWorldDisplay, which\\nis a nested static class inside the HelloWorldGUI2 class. (Nested classes were introduced in\\nSubsection 5.7.2.) This class deﬁnes just one instance meth od, paintComponent(), which\\noverrides a method of the same name in the JPanel class:\\nprivate static class HelloWorldDisplay extends JPanel {\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\\nsuper.paintComponent(g);\\ng.drawString( \"Hello World!\", 20, 30 );\\n}\\n}\\nThe paintComponent() method is called by the system when a component needs to be pai nted\\non the screen. In the JPanel class, the paintComponent method simply ﬁlls the panel with the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'AFPL Ghostscript 8.51', 'creator': 'dvips(k) 5.95b Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software', 'creationdate': 'D:20071115202101', 'moddate': 'D:20071115202101', 'title': 'javanotes.dvi', 'source': '../data/rag_data/javanotes5.pdf', 'total_pages': 699, 'page': 244, 'page_label': '245', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='6.1. THE BASIC GUI APPLICA TION 229\\npanel’s background color. The paintComponent() method in HelloWorldDisplay begins by call-\\ning super.paintComponent(g). This calls the version of paintComponent() that is deﬁned in\\nthe superclass, JPanel; that is, it ﬁlls the panel with the background color. (See Su bsection 5.6.2\\nfor a discussion of the special variable super.) Then it calls g.drawString() to paint the string\\n“Hello W orld!” onto the panel. The net result is that wheneve r a HelloWorldDisplay is shown\\non the screen, it displays the string “Hello W orld!”.\\nW e will often use JPanels in this way , as drawing surfaces. Usually , when we do this, w e will\\ndeﬁne a nested class that is a subclass of JPanel and we will write a paintComponent method\\nin that class to draw the desired content in the panel.\\n6.1.2 Components and Layout\\nAnother way of using a JPanel is as a container to hold other components. Java has many\\nclasses that deﬁne GUI components. Before these components can appear on the screen, they\\nmust be added to a container. In this program, the variable named content refers to a JPanel\\nthat is used as a container, and two other components are adde d to that container. This is\\ndone in the statements:\\ncontent.add(displayPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);\\ncontent.add(okButton, BorderLayout.SOUTH);\\nHere, content refers to an object of type JPanel; later in the program, this panel becomes the\\ncontent pane of the window. The ﬁrst component that is added t o content is displayPanel\\nwhich, as discussed above, displays the message, “Hello W or ld!”. The second is okButton which\\nrepresents the button that the user clicks to close the windo w. The variable okButton is of\\ntype JButton, the Java class that represents push buttons.\\nThe “BorderLayout” stuﬀ in these statements has to do with ho w the two components are\\narranged in the container. When components are added to a con tainer, there has to be some way\\nof deciding how those components are arranged inside the con tainer. This is called “laying out”\\nthe components in the container, and the most common techniq ue for laying out components\\nis to use a layout manager . A layout manager is an object that implements some policy fo r\\nhow to arrange the components in a container; diﬀerent types of layout manager implement\\ndiﬀerent policies. One type of layout manager is deﬁned by th e BorderLayout class. In the\\nprogram, the statement\\ncontent.setLayout(new BorderLayout());\\ncreates a new BorderLayout object and tells the content panel to use the new object as its layout\\nmanager. Essentially , this line determines how components that are added to the content panel\\nwill be arranged inside the panel. W e will cover layout manag ers in much more detail later, but\\nfor now all you need to know is that adding okButton in the BorderLayout.SOUTH position puts\\nthe button at the bottom of the panel, and putting displayPanel in the BorderLayout.CENTER\\nposition makes it ﬁll any space that is not taken up by the butt on.\\nThis example shows a general technique for setting up a GUI: C reate a container and assign\\na layout manager to it, create components and add them to the c ontainer, and use the container\\nas the content pane of a window or applet. A container is itsel f a component, so it is possible\\nthat some of the components that are added to the top-level co ntainer are themselves containers,\\nwith their own layout managers and components. This makes it possible to build up complex\\nuser interfaces in a hierarchical fashion, with containers inside containers inside containers. . .'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\n6.1.3 Events and Listeners\\nThe structure of containers and components sets up the physi cal appearance of a GUI, but\\nit doesn’t say anything about how the GUI behaves. That is, what can the user do to the\\nGUI and how will it respond? GUIs are largely event-driven; that is, the program waits\\nfor events that are generated by the user’s actions (or by som e other cause). When an event\\noccurs, the program responds by executing an event-handling method . In order to program\\nthe behavior of a GUI, you have to write event-handling metho ds to respond to the events that\\nyou are interested in.\\nThe most common technique for handling events in Java is to us e event listeners . A\\nlistener is an object that includes one or more event-handli ng methods. When an event is\\ndetected by another object, such as a button or menu, the list ener object is notiﬁed and it\\nresponds by running the appropriate event-handling method . An event is detected or generated\\nby an object. Another object, the listener, has the responsi bility of responding to the event.\\nThe event itself is actually represented by a third object, w hich carries information about the\\ntype of event, when it occurred, and so on. This division of re sponsibilities makes it easier to\\norganize large programs.\\nAs an example, consider the OK button in the sample program. W hen the user clicks the\\nbutton, an event is generated. This event is represented by a n object belonging to the class\\nActionEvent. The event that is generated is associated with the button; w e say that the button\\nis the source of the event. The listener object in this case is an object bel onging to the class\\nButtonHandler, which is deﬁned as a nested class inside HelloWorldGUI2:\\nprivate static class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener {\\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\\nSystem.exit(0);\\n}\\n}\\nThis class implements the ActionListener interface—a requirement for listener objects that\\nhandle events from buttons. (Interfaces were introduced in Subsection 5.7.1.) The event-\\nhandling method is named actionPerformed, as speciﬁed by the ActionListener interface. This\\nmethod contains the code that is executed when the user click s the button; in this case, the\\ncode is a call to System.exit(), which will terminate the program.\\nThere is one more ingredient that is necessary to get the even t from the button to the\\nlistener object: The listener object must register itself with the button as an event listener.\\nThis is done with the statement:\\nokButton.addActionListener(listener);\\nThis statement tells okButton that when the user clicks the button, the ActionEvent that is\\ngenerated should be sent to listener. Without this statement, the button has no way of\\nknowing that some other object would like to listen for event s from the button.\\nThis example shows a general technique for programming the b ehavior of a GUI: W rite\\nclasses that include event-handling methods. Create objec ts that belong to these classes and\\nregister them as listeners with the objects that will actual ly detect or generate the events. When\\nan event occurs, the listener is notiﬁed, and the code that yo u wrote in one of its event-handling\\nmethods is executed. At ﬁrst, this might seem like a very roun dabout and complicated way to\\nget things done, but as you gain experience with it, you will ﬁ nd that it is very ﬂexible and\\nthat it goes together very well with object oriented program ming. (W e will return to events'),\n",

APPLETS AND HTML 231\\nand listeners in much more detail in Section 6.3 and later sec tions, and I do not expect you to\\ncompletely understand them at this time.)\\n6.2 Applets and HTML\\nAlthough stand-alone applications are probably more important than applets at this\\npoint in the history of Java, applets are still widely used. T hey can do things on W eb pages\\nthat can’t easily be done with other technologies. It is easy to distribute applets to users: The\\nuser just has to open a W eb page, and the applet is there, with n o special installation required\\n(although the user must have an appropriate version of Java i nstalled on their computer). And\\nof course, applets are fun; now that the W eb has become such a c ommon part of life, it’s nice\\nto be able to see your work running on a web page.\\nThe good news is that writing applets is not much diﬀerent fro m writing stand-alone appli-\\ncations. The structure of an applet is essentially the same a s the structure of the JFrames that\\nwere introduced in the previous section, and events are hand led in the same way in both types\\nof program. So, most of what you learn about applications app lies to applets, and vice versa .\\nOf course, one diﬀerence is that an applet is dependent on a W e b page, so to use applets\\neﬀectively , you have to learn at least a little about creatin g W eb pages. W eb pages are written\\nusing a language called HTML (HyperT ext Markup Language). In Subsection 6.2.3, below,\\nyou’ll learn how to use HTML to create W eb pages that display a pplets.\\n6.2.1 JApplet\\nThe JApplet class (in package javax.swing) can be used as a basis for writing applets in the\\nsame way that JFrame is used for writing stand-alone applications. The basic JApplet class\\nrepresents a blank rectangular area. Since an applet is not a stand-alone application, this area\\nmust appear on a W eb page, or in some other environment that kn ows how to display an applet.\\nLike a JFrame, a JApplet contains a content pane (and can contain a menu bar). Y ou can a dd\\ncontent to an applet either by adding content to its content p ane or by replacing the content\\npane with another component. In my examples, I will generall y create a JPanel and use it as a\\nreplacement for the applet’s content pane.\\nT o create an applet, you will write a subclass of JApplet. The JApplet class deﬁnes several\\ninstance methods that are unique to applets. These methods a re called by the applet’s environ-\\nment at certain points during the applet’s “life cycle.” In t he JApplet class itself, these methods\\ndo nothing; you can override these methods in a subclass. The most important of these special\\napplet methods is\\npublic void init()\\nAn applet’s init() method is called when the applet is created. Y ou can use the init() method\\nas a place where you can set up the physical structure of the ap plet and the event handling\\nthat will determine its behavior. (Y ou can also do some initi alization in the constructor for\\nyour class, but there are certain aspects of the applet’s env ironment that are set up after its\\nconstructor is called but before the init() method is called, so there are a few operations\\nthat will work in the init() method but will not work in the constructor.) The other apple t\\nlife-cycle methods are start(), stop(), and destroy(). I will not use these methods for the\\ntime being and will not discuss them here except to mention th at destroy() is called at the\\nend of the applet’s lifetime and can be used as a place to do any necessary cleanup, such as\\nclosing any windows that were opened by the applet.'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nWith this in mind, we can look at our ﬁrst example of a JApplet. It is, of course, an applet\\nthat says “Hello W orld!”. T o make it a little more interestin g, I have added a button that\\nchanges the text of the message, and a state variable, currentMessage, that holds the text of the\\ncurrent message. This example is very similar to the stand-a lone application HelloWorldGUI2\\nfrom the previous section. It uses an event-handling class t o respond when the user clicks the\\nbutton, a panel to display the message, and another panel tha t serves as a container for the\\nmessage panel and the button. The second panel becomes the co ntent pane of the applet. Here\\nis the source code for the applet; again, you are not expected to understand all the details at\\nthis time:\\nimport java.awt.*;\\nimport java.awt.event.*;\\nimport javax.swing.*;\\n/**\\n* A simple applet that can display the messages \"Hello World\"\\n* and \"Goodbye World\". The applet contains a button, and it\\n* switches from one message to the other when the button is\\n* clicked.\\n*/\\npublic class HelloWorldApplet extends JApplet {\\nprivate String currentMessage = \"Hello World!\"; // Currently displayed message.\\nprivate MessageDisplay displayPanel; // The panel where th e message is displayed.\\nprivate class MessageDisplay extends JPanel { // Defines th e display panel.\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\\nsuper.paintComponent(g);\\ng.drawString(currentMessage, 20, 30);\\n}\\n}\\nprivate class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener { / / The event listener.\\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\\nif (currentMessage.equals(\"Hello World!\"))\\ncurrentMessage = \"Goodbye World!\";\\nelse\\ncurrentMessage = \"Hello World!\";\\ndisplayPanel.repaint(); // Paint display panel with new message.\\n}\\n}\\n/**\\n* The applet’s init() method creates the button and display panel and\\n* adds them to the applet, and it sets up a listener to respond to\\n* clicks on the button.\\n*/\\npublic void init() {\\ndisplayPanel = new MessageDisplay();\\nJButton changeMessageButton = new JButton(\"Change Message\");\\nButtonHandler listener = new ButtonHandler();\\nchangeMessageButton.addActionListener(listener);\\nJPanel content = new JPanel();\\ncontent.setLayout(new BorderLayout());'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'AFPL Ghostscript 8.51', 'creator': 'dvips(k) 5.95b Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software', 'creationdate': 'D:20071115202101', 'moddate': 'D:20071115202101', 'title': 'javanotes.dvi', 'source': '../data/rag_data/javanotes5.pdf', 'total_pages': 699, 'page': 248, 'page_label': '249', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='6.2. APPLETS AND HTML 233\\ncontent.add(displayPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);\\ncontent.add(changeMessageButton, BorderLayout.SOUTH);\\nsetContentPane(content);\\n}\\n}\\nY ou should compare this class with HelloWorldGUI2.java from the previous section. One\\nsubtle diﬀerence that you will notice is that the member vari ables and nested classes in this\\nexample are non-static. Remember that an applet is an object . A single class can be used to\\nmake several applets, and each of those applets will need its own copy of the applet data, so\\nthe member variables in which the data is stored must be non-s tatic instance variables. Since\\nthe variables are non-static, the two nested classes, which use those variables, must also be\\nnon-static. (Static nested classes cannot access non-stat ic member variables in the containing\\nclass; see Subsection 5.7.2.) Remember the basic rule for de ciding whether to make a nested\\nclass static: If it needs access to any instance variable or i nstance method in the containing\\nclass, the nested class must be non-static; otherwise, it ca n be declared to be static.\\n6.2.2 Reusing Your JPanels\\nBoth applets and frames can be programmed in the same way: Des ign a JPanel, and use it to\\nreplace the default content pane in the applet or frame. This makes it very easy to write two\\nversions of a program, one which runs as an applet and one whic h runs as a frame. The idea is\\nto create a subclass of JPanel that represents the content pane for your program; all the ha rd\\nprogramming work is done in this panel class. An object of thi s class can then be used as the\\ncontent pane either in a frame or in an applet. Only a very simp le main() program is needed\\nto show your panel in a frame, and only a very simple applet cla ss is needed to show your panel\\nin an applet, so it’s easy to make both versions.\\nAs an example, we can rewrite HelloWorldApplet by writing a subclass of JPanel. That class\\ncan then be reused to make a frame in a standalone application . This class is very similar to\\nHelloWorldApplet, but now the initialization is done in a constructor instead of in an init()\\nmethod:\\nimport java.awt.*;\\nimport java.awt.event.*;\\nimport javax.swing.*;\\npublic class HelloWorldPanel extends JPanel {\\nprivate String currentMessage = \"Hello World!\"; // Currently displayed message.\\nprivate MessageDisplay displayPanel; // The panel where th e message is displayed.\\nprivate class MessageDisplay extends JPanel { // Defines th e display panel.\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\\nsuper.paintComponent(g);\\ng.drawString(currentMessage, 20, 30);\\n}\\n}\\nprivate class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener { / / The event listener.\\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\\nif (currentMessage.equals(\"Hello World!\"))\\ncurrentMessage = \"Goodbye World!\";'),\n",

APPLETS AND HTML 235\\nThis says that when the user closes the window by clicking the close box in the title bar of the\\nwindow, the program should be terminated.

Without this line, the default close oper ation of the window would simply\\nhide the window when the user clicks the close box, leaving th e program running. This brings\\nup one of the diﬃculties of reusing the same panel class both i n an applet and in a frame: There\\nare some things that a stand-alone application can do that an applet can’t do.

Such pages are themselves writt en in a language called HTML\\n(HyperT ext Markup Language). An HTML document describes th e contents of a page. A W eb\\nbrowser interprets the HTML code to determine what to displa y on the page. The HTML code\\ndoesn’t look much like the resulting page that appears in the browser. The HTML document\\ndoes contain all the text that appears on the page, but that te xt is “marked up” with commands\\nthat determine the structure and appearance of the text and d etermine what will appear on\\nthe page in addition to the text.\\nHTML has become a rather complicated language. In this secti on, I will cover just the\\nmost basic aspects of the language. Y ou can easily ﬁnd more in formation on the W eb, if you\\nwant to learn more. Although there are many W eb-authoring pr ograms that make it possible\\nto create W eb pages without ever looking at the underlying HT ML code, it is possible to write\\nan HTML page using an ordinary text editor, typing in all the m ark-up commands by hand,\\nand it is worthwhile to learn how to create at least simple pag es in this way .\\nThere is a strict syntax for HTML documents (although in prac tice W eb browsers will do\\ntheir best to display a page even if it does not follow the synt ax strictly).

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nwhere the ⟨tag-name⟩ is a word that speciﬁes the command, and the ⟨optional-modiﬁers ⟩, if\\npresent, are used to provide additional information for the command (much like parameters in\\nsubroutines). A modiﬁer takes the form\\n⟨modifier-name ⟩ = ⟨value ⟩\\nUsually , the ⟨value⟩ is enclosed in quotes, and it must be if it is more than one word long or if\\nit contains certain special characters. There are a few modi ﬁers which have no value, in which\\ncase only the name of the modiﬁer is present. HTML is case inse nsitive, which means that\\nyou can use upper case and lower case letters interchangeabl y in tags and modiﬁers. (However,\\nlower case is generally used because XHTML, a successor lang uage to HTML, requires lower\\ncase.)\\nA simple example of a tag is <hr>, which draws a line—also called a “horizontal rule”—\\nacross the page. The hr tag can take several possible modiﬁers such as width and align. F or\\nexample, a horizontal line that extends halfway across the p age could be generated with the\\ntag:\\n<hr width=\"50%\">\\nThe width here is speciﬁed as 50% of the available space, meaning a line that extends halfway\\nacross the page. The width could also be given as a ﬁxed number of pixels.\\nMany tags require matching closing tags, which take the form\\n</⟨tag-name ⟩>\\nF or example, the <html> tag at the beginning of an HTML document must be matched\\nby a closing </html> tag at the end of the document. As another example, the tag <pre>\\nmust always have a matching closing tag </pre> later in the document. An opening/closing\\ntag pair applies to everything that comes between the openin g tag and the closing tag. The\\n<pre> tag tells a W eb browser to display everything between the <pre> and the </pre> just as\\nit is formatted in the original HTML source code, including a ll the spaces and carriage returns.\\n(But tags between <pre> and </pre> are still interpreted by the browser.) “Pre” stands for\\npreformatted text. All of the sample programs in the on-line version of this book are formatted\\nusing the <pre> command.\\nIt is important for you to understand that when you don’t use <pre>, the computer will\\ncompletely ignore the formatting of the text in the HTML sour ce code. The only thing it pays\\nattention to is the tags. Five blank lines in the source code h ave no more eﬀect than one blank\\nline or even a single blank space. Outside of <pre>, if you want to force a new line on the\\nW eb page, you can use the tag <br>, which stands for “break”. F or example, I might give my\\naddress as:\\nDavid Eck<br>\\nDepartment of Mathematics and Computer Science<br>\\nHobart and William Smith Colleges<br>\\nGeneva, NY 14456<br>\\nIf you want extra vertical space in your web page, you can use s everal <br>’s in a row.\\nSimilarly , you need a tag to indicate how the text should be br oken up into paragraphs.\\nThis is done with the <p> tag, which should be placed at the beginning of every paragra ph.\\nThe <p> tag has a matching </p>, which should be placed at the end of each paragraph. The\\nclosing </p> is technically optional, but it is considered good form to us e it. If you want all the\\nlines of the paragraph to be shoved over to the right, you can u se <p align=right> instead of'),\n",

APPLETS AND HTML 237\\n<p>. (This is mostly useful when used with one short line, or when used with <br> to make\\nseveral short lines.) Y ou can also use <p align=center> for centered lines.\\nBy the way , if tags like <p> and <hr> have special meanings in HTML, you might wonder\\nhow one can get them to appear literally on a web page. T o get ce rtain special characters to\\nappear on the page, you have to use an entity name in the HTML source code. The entity\\nname for < is &lt;, and the entity name for > is &gt;. Entity names begin with & and end with\\na semicolon. The character & is itself a special character whose entity name is &amp;. There\\nare also entity names for nonstandard characters such as an a ccented “e”, which has the entity\\nname &eacute;.\\nThere are several useful tags that change the appearance of t ext. F or example, to get italic\\ntext, enclose the text between <i> and </i>. F or example,\\n<i>Introduction to Programming using Java</i>\\nin an HTML document gives Introduction to Programming using Java in italics when the\\ndocument is displayed as a W eb page. Similarly , the tags <b>, <u>, and <tt> can be used\\nfor bold, underlined , and typewriter-style (“monospace”) text.\\nA headline, with very large text, can be made by placing the th e text between <h1> and\\n</h1>. Headlines with smaller text can be made using <h2> or <h3> instead of <h1>. Note\\nthat these headline tags stand on their own; they are not used inside paragraphs. Y ou can add\\nthe modiﬁer align=center to center the headline, and you can include break tags ( <br>) in a\\nheadline to break it up into multiple lines. F or example, the following HTML code will produce\\na medium–sized, centered, two-line headline:\\n<h2 align=center>Chapter 6:<br>Introduction to GUI Programming</h2>\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe most distinctive feature of HTML is that documents can co ntain links to other docu-\\nments. The user can follow links from page to page and in the pr ocess visit pages from all over\\nthe Internet.\\nThe <a> tag is used to create a link. The text between the <a> and its matching </a>\\nappears on the page as the text of the link; the user can follow the link by clicking on this\\ntext. The <a> tag uses the modiﬁer href to say which document the link should connect to.\\nThe value for href must be a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). A URL is a coded set of\\ninstructions for ﬁnding a document on the Internet. F or exam ple, the URL for my own “home\\npage” is\\nhttp://math.hws.edu/eck/\\nT o make a link to this page, I would use the HTML source code\\n<a href=\"http://math.hws.edu/eck/\">David’s Home Page</a>\\nThe best place to ﬁnd URLs is on existing W eb pages. W eb browse rs display the URL for the\\npage you are currently viewing, and they can display the URL o f a link if you point to the link\\nwith the mouse.\\nIf you are writing an HTML document and you want to make a link t o another document\\nthat is in the same directory , you can use a relative URL . The relative URL consists of just the\\nname of the ﬁle. F or example, to create a link to a ﬁle named “s1 .html” in the same directory\\nas the HTML document that you are writing, you could use\\n<a href=\"s1.html\">Section 1</a>'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nThere are also relative URLs for linking to ﬁles that are in ot her directories. Using relative\\nURLs is a good idea, since if you use them, you can move a whole c ollection of ﬁles without\\nchanging any of the links between them (as long as you don’t ch ange the relative locations of\\nthe ﬁles).\\nWhen you type a URL into a W eb browser, you can omit the “http:/ /” at the beginning of\\nthe URL. However, in an <a> tag in an HTML document, the “http://” can only be omitted if\\nthe URL is a relative URL. F or a normal URL, it is required.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nY ou can add images to a W eb page with the <img> tag. (This is a tag that has no matching\\nclosing tag.) The actual image must be stored in a separate ﬁl e from the HTML document.\\nThe <img> tag has a required modiﬁer, named src, to specify the URL of the image ﬁle. F or\\nmost browsers, the image should be in one of the formats PNG (w ith a ﬁle name ending in\\n“.png”), JPEG (with a ﬁle name ending in “.jpeg” or “.jpg”), o r GIF (with a ﬁle name ending\\nin “.gif”). Usually , the image is stored in the same place as t he HTML document, and a relative\\nURL—that is, just the name of the image ﬁle—is used to specify the image ﬁle.\\nThe <img> tag also has several optional modiﬁers. It’s a good idea to al ways include the\\nheight and width modiﬁers, which specify the size of the image in pixels. Some browsers\\nhandle images better if they know in advance how big they are. The align modiﬁer can be\\nused to aﬀect the placement of the image: “align=right” will shove the image to the right edge\\nof the page, and the text on the page will ﬂow around the image; “align=left” works similarly .\\n(Unfortunately , “align=center” doesn’t have the meaning y ou would expect. Browsers treat\\nimages as if they are just big characters. Images can occur in side paragraphs, links, and\\nheadings, for example. Alignment values of center, top, and bottom are used to specify how\\nthe image should line up with other characters in a line of tex t: Should the baseline of the text\\nbe at the center, the top, or the bottom of the image? Alignmen t values of right and left\\nwere added to HTML later, but they are the most useful values. If you want an image centered\\non the page, put it inside a <p align=center> tag.)\\nF or example, here is HTML code that will place an image from a ﬁ le named ﬁgure1.png on\\nthe page.\\n<img src=\"figure1.png\" align=right height=150 width=100>\\nThe image is 100 pixels wide and 150 pixels high, and it will ap pear on the right edge of the\\npage.\\n6.2.4 Applets on Web Pages\\nThe main point of this whole discussion of HTML is to learn how to use applets on the W eb.\\nThe <applet> tag can be used to add a Java applet to a W eb page. This tag must h ave a\\nmatching </applet>. A required modiﬁer named code gives the name of the compiled class\\nﬁle that contains the applet class. The modiﬁers height and width are required to specify the\\nsize of the applet, in pixels. If you want the applet to be cent ered on the page, you can put\\nthe applet in a paragraph with center alignment So, an applet tag to display an applet named\\nHelloWorldApplet centered on a W eb page would look like this:\\n<p align=center>\\n<applet code=\"HelloWorldApplet.class\" height=100 width=250>\\n</applet>\\n</p>'),\n",

APPLETS AND HTML 239\\nThis assumes that the ﬁle HelloWorldApplet.class is located in the same directory with\\nthe HTML document. If this is not the case, you can use another modiﬁer, codebase, to give\\nthe URL of the directory that contains the class ﬁle. The valu e of code itself is always just a\\nclass, not a URL.\\nIf the applet uses other classes in addition to the applet cla ss itself, then those class ﬁles\\nmust be in the same directory as the applet class (always assu ming that your classes are all in\\nthe “default package”; see Subsection 2.6.4). If an applet r equires more than one or two class\\nﬁles, it’s a good idea to collect all the class ﬁles into a sing le jar ﬁle. Jar ﬁles are “archive ﬁles”\\nwhich hold a number of smaller ﬁles. If your class ﬁles are in a jar archive, then you have to\\nspecify the name of the jar ﬁle in an archive modiﬁer in the <applet> tag, as in\\n<applet code=\"HelloWorldApplet.class\" archive=\"HelloWorld.jar\" height=50...\\nI will have more to say about creating and using jar ﬁles at the end of this chapter.\\nApplets can use applet parameters to customize their behavior. Applet parameters are\\nspeciﬁed by using <param> tags, which can only occur between an <applet> tag and the closing\\n</applet>. The param tag has required modiﬁers named name and value, and it takes the\\nform\\n<param name=\" ⟨param-name ⟩\" value=\" ⟨param-value ⟩\">\\nThe parameters are available to the applet when it runs. An ap plet can use the predeﬁned\\nmethod getParameter() to check for parameters speciﬁed in param tags. The getParameter()\\nmethod has the following interface:\\nString getParameter(String paramName)\\nThe parameter paramName corresponds to the ⟨param-name⟩ in a param tag. If the speciﬁed\\nparamName actually occurs in one of the param tags, then getParameter(paramName) returns\\nthe associated ⟨param-value⟩. If the speciﬁed paramName does not occur in any param tag, then\\ngetParameter(paramName) returns the value null. Parameter names are case-sensitive, so you\\ncannot use “size” in the param tag and ask for “Size” in getParameter. The getParameter()\\nmethod is often called in the applet’s init() method. It will not work correctly in the applet’s\\nconstructor, since it depends on information about the appl et’s environment that is not available\\nwhen the constructor is called.\\nHere is an example of an applet tag with several params:\\n<applet code=\"ShowMessage.class\" width=200 height=50>\\n<param name=\"message\" value=\"Goodbye World!\">\\n<param name=\"font\" value=\"Serif\">\\n<param name=\"size\" value=\"36\">\\n</applet>\\nThe ShowMessage applet would presumably read these parameters in its init() method,\\nwhich could go something like this:\\nString message; // Instance variable: message to be display ed.\\nString fontName; // Instance variable: font to use for display.\\nint fontSize; // Instance variable: size of the display font .\\npublic void init() {\\nString value;\\nvalue = getParameter(\"message\"); // Get message param, if any.\\nif (value == null)'),\n",

If the param represents\\na numerical value, the string must be converted into a number , as is done here for the size\\nparameter.\\n6.3 Graphics and Painting\\nEverthing you see on a computer screen has to be drawn there, even the text. The\\nJava API includes a range of classes and methods that are devo ted to drawing. In this section,\\nI’ll look at some of the most basic of these.\\nThe physical structure of a GUI is built of components. The te rm component refers to a\\nvisual element in a GUI, including buttons, menus, text-inp ut boxes, scroll bars, check boxes,\\nand so on. In Java, GUI components are represented by objects belonging to subclasses of the\\nclass java.awt.Component. Most components in the Swing GUI—although not top-level co m-\\nponents like JApplet and JF rame—belong to subclasses of the class javax.swing.JComponent,\\nwhich is itself a subclass of java.awt.Component. Every component is responsible for drawing\\nitself. If you want to use a standard component, you only have to add it to your applet or frame.\\nY ou don’t have to worry about painting it on the screen. That w ill happen automatically , since\\nit already knows how to draw itself.\\nSometimes, however, you do want to draw on a component. Y ou wi ll have to do this\\nwhenever you want to display something that is not included a mong the standard, pre-deﬁned\\ncomponent classes. When you want to do this, you have to deﬁne your own component class\\nand provide a method in that class for drawing the component. I will always use a subclass\\nof JPanel when I need a drawing surface of this kind, as I did for the MessageDisplay class in\\nthe example HelloWorldApplet.java in the previous section. A JPanel, like any JComponent,\\ndraws its content in the method\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g)\\nT o create a drawing surface, you should deﬁne a subclass of JPanel and provide a custom\\npaintComponent() method. Create an object belonging to this class and use it in your applet'),\n",

GRAPHICS AND P AINTING 241\\nor frame. When the time comes for your component to be drawn on the screen, the system\\nwill call its paintComponent() to do the drawing. That is, the code that you put into the\\npaintComponent() method will be executed whenever the panel needs to be drawn o n the\\nscreen; by writing this method, you determine the picture th at will be displayed in the panel.\\nNote that the paintComponent() method has a parameter of type Graphics. The Graphics\\nobject will be provided by the system when it calls your metho d. Y ou need this object to\\ndo the actual drawing. T o do any drawing at all in Java, you nee d a graphics context . A\\ngraphics context is an object belonging to the class java.awt.Graphics. Instance methods\\nare provided in this class for drawing shapes, text, and imag es. Any given Graphics object\\ncan draw to only one location. In this chapter, that location will always be a GUI component\\nbelonging to some subclass of JPanel. The Graphics class is an abstract class, which means\\nthat it is impossible to create a graphics context directly , with a constructor. There are actually\\ntwo ways to get a graphics context for drawing on a component: First of all, of course, when\\nthe paintComponent() method of a component is called by the system, the parameter t o that\\nmethod is a graphics context for drawing on the component. Se cond, every component has\\nan instance method called getGraphics(). This method is a function that returns a graphics\\ncontext that can be used for drawing on the component outside its paintComponent() method.\\nThe oﬃcial line is that you should not do this, and I will avoid it for the most part. But I have\\nfound it convenient to use getGraphics() in a few cases.\\nThe paintComponent() method in the JPanel class simply ﬁlls the panel with the panel’s\\nbackground color. When deﬁning a subclass of JPanel for use as a drawing surface, you will\\nalmost always want to ﬁll the panel with the background color before drawing other content\\nonto the panel (although it is not necessary to do this if the d rawing commands in the method\\ncover the background of the component completely .) This is t raditionally done with a call to\\nsuper.paintComponent(g), so most paintComponent() methods that you write will have the\\nform:\\npublic void paintComponent(g) {\\nsuper.paintComponent(g);\\n. . . // Draw the content of the component.\\n}\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nMost components do, in fact, do all drawing operations in the ir paintComponent() methods.\\nWhat happens if, in the middle of some other method, you reali ze that the content of the\\ncomponent needs to be changed? Y ou should not call paintComponent() directly to make the\\nchange; this method is meant to be called only by the system. I nstead, you have to inform\\nthe system that the component needs to be redrawn, and let the system do its job by calling\\npaintComponent(). Y ou do this by calling the component’s repaint() method. The method\\npublic void repaint();\\nis deﬁned in the Component class, and so can be used with any component. Y ou should call\\nrepaint() to inform the system that the component needs to be redrawn. T he repaint()\\nmethod returns immediately , without doing any painting its elf. The system will call the com-\\nponent’s paintComponent() method later, as soon as it gets a chance to do so, after processing\\nother pending events if there are any .\\nNote that the system can also call paintComponent() for other reasons. It is called when\\nthe component ﬁrst appears on the screen. It will also be call ed if the component is resized or if\\nit is covered up by another window and then uncovered. The sys tem does not save a copy of the'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\ncomponent’s contents when it is covered. When it is uncovere d, the component is responsible\\nfor redrawing itself. (As you will see, some of our early exam ples will not be able to do this\\ncorrectly .)\\nThis means that, to work properly , the paintComponent() method must be smart enough\\nto correctly redraw the component at any time. T o make this po ssible, a program should store\\ndata about the state of the component in its instance variabl es. These variables should contain\\nall the information necessary to redraw the component compl etely . The paintComponent()\\nmethod should use the data in these variables to decide what t o draw. When the program\\nwants to change the content of the component, it should not si mply draw the new content.\\nIt should change the values of the relevant variables and cal l repaint(). When the system\\ncalls paintComponent(), that method will use the new values of the variables and will draw\\nthe component with the desired modiﬁcations. This might see m a roundabout way of doing\\nthings. Why not just draw the modiﬁcations directly? There a re at least two reasons. First\\nof all, it really does turn out to be easier to get things right if all drawing is done in one\\nmethod. Second, even if you did make modiﬁcations directly , you would still have to make the\\npaintComponent() method aware of them in some way so that it will be able to redraw the\\ncomponent correctly on demand.\\nY ou will see how all this works in practice as we work through e xamples in the rest of this\\nchapter. F or now, we will spend the rest of this section looki ng at how to get some actual\\ndrawing done.\\n6.3.1 Coordinates\\nThe screen of a computer is a grid of little squares called pixels. The color of each pixel can be\\nset individually , and drawing on the screen just means setti ng the colors of individual pixels.\\nA graphics context draws in a rectangle made up of pixels. A po sition in the rectangle\\nis speciﬁed by a pair of integer coordinates, (x,y). The upper left corner has coordinates\\n(0,0). The x coordinate increases from left to right, and the y coordinate increases from top\\nto bottom. The illustration shows a 16-by-10 pixel componen t (with very large pixels). A small\\nline, rectangle, and oval are shown as they would be drawn by c oloring individual pixels. (Note\\nthat, properly speaking, the coordinates don’t belong to th e pixels but to the grid lines between\\nthem.)\\nF or any component, you can ﬁnd out the size of the rectangle th at it occupies by calling\\nthe instance methods getWidth() and getHeight(), which return the number of pixels in the\\nhorizontal and vertical directions, respectively . In gene ral, it’s not a good idea to assume that\\nyou know the size of a component, since the size is often set by a layout manager and can'),\n",

GRAPHICS AND P AINTING 243\\neven change if the component is in a window and that window is r esized by the user. This\\nmeans that it’s good form to check the size of a component befo re doing any drawing on that\\ncomponent. F or example, you can use a paintComponent() method that looks like:\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\\nsuper.paintComponent(g);\\nint width = getWidth(); // Find out the width of this componen t.\\nint height = getHeight(); // Find out its height.\\n. . . // Draw the content of the component.\\n}\\nOf course, your drawing commands will have to take the size in to account. That is, they\\nwill have to use (x,y) coordinates that are calculated based on the actual height a nd width of\\nthe component.\\n6.3.2 Colors\\nY ou will probably want to use some color when you draw. Java is designed to work with\\nthe RGB color system . An RGB color is speciﬁed by three numbers that give the level\\nof red, green, and blue, respectively , in the color. A color i n Java is an object of the class,\\njava.awt.Color. Y ou can construct a new color by specifying its red, blue, an d green compo-\\nnents. F or example,\\nColor myColor = new Color(r,g,b);\\nThere are two constructors that you can call in this way . In th e one that I almost al-\\nways use, r, g, and b are integers in the range 0 to 255. In the other, they are num-\\nbers of type ﬂoat in the range 0.0F to 1.0F. (Recall that a literal of type ﬂoat is written\\nwith an “F” to distinguish it from a double number.) Often, you can avoid constructing\\nnew colors altogether, since the Color class deﬁnes several named constants representing com-\\nmon colors: Color.WHITE, Color.BLACK, Color.RED, Color.GREEN, Color.BLUE, Color.CYAN,\\nColor.MAGENTA, Color.YELLOW, Color.PINK, Color.ORANGE, Color.LIGHT\\nGRAY, Color.GRAY,\\nand Color.DARK GRAY. (There are older, alternative names for these constants th at use lower\\ncase rather than upper case constants, such as Color.red instead of Color.RED, but the upper\\ncase versions are preferred because they follow the convent ion that constant names should be\\nupper case.)\\nAn alternative to RGB is the HSB color system . In the HSB system, a color is speciﬁed by\\nthree numbers called the hue, the saturation, and the brightness. The hue is the basic color,\\nranging from red through orange through all the other colors of the rainbow. The brightness is\\npretty much what it sounds like. A fully saturated color is a p ure color tone. Decreasing the\\nsaturation is like mixing white or gray paint into the pure co lor. In Java, the hue, saturation\\nand brightness are always speciﬁed by values of type ﬂoat in the range from 0.0F to 1.0F. The\\nColor class has a static member function named getHSBColor for creating HSB colors. T o\\ncreate the color with HSB values given by h, s, and b, you can say:\\nColor myColor = Color.getHSBColor(h,s,b);\\nF or example, to make a color with a random hue that is as bright and as saturated as possible,\\nyou could use:\\nColor randomColor = Color.getHSBColor( (float)Math.random(), 1.0F, 1.0F );'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nThe type cast is necessary because the value returned by Math.random() is of type double,\\nand Color.getHSBColor() requires values of type ﬂoat . (By the way , you might ask why\\nRGB colors are created using a constructor while HSB colors a re created using a static member\\nfunction. The problem is that we would need two diﬀerent cons tructors, both of them with\\nthree parameters of type ﬂoat . Unfortunately , this is impossible. Y ou can have two constr uctors\\nonly if the number of parameters or the parameter types diﬀer .)\\nThe RGB system and the HSB system are just diﬀerent ways of des cribing the same set of\\ncolors. It is possible to translate between one system and th e other. The best way to understand\\nthe color systems is to experiment with them. In the on-line v ersion of this section, you will\\nﬁnd an applet that you can use to experiment with RGB and HSB co lors.\\nOne of the properties of a Graphics object is the current drawing color, which is used for\\nall drawing of shapes and text. If g is a graphics context, you can change the current drawing\\ncolor for g using the method g.setColor(c), where c is a Color. F or example, if you want\\nto draw in green, you would just say g.setColor(Color.GREEN) before doing the drawing.\\nThe graphics context continues to use the color until you exp licitly change it with another\\nsetColor() command. If you want to know what the current drawing color is , you can call the\\nfunction g.getColor(), which returns an object of type Color. This can be useful if you want\\nto change to another drawing color temporarily and then rest ore the previous drawing color.\\nEvery component has an associated foreground color and background color . Generally ,\\nthe component is ﬁlled with the background color before anyt hing else is drawn (although some\\ncomponents are “transparent,” meaning that the background color is ignored). When a new\\ngraphics context is created for a component, the current dra wing color is set to the foreground\\ncolor. Note that the foreground color and background color a re properties of the component,\\nnot of a graphics context.\\nThe foreground and background colors can be set by instance m ethods setForeground(c)\\nand setBackground(c), which are deﬁned in the Component class and therefore are available\\nfor use with any component. This can be useful even for standa rd components, if you want\\nthem to use colors that are diﬀerent from the defaults.\\n6.3.3 F onts\\nA font represents a particular size and style of text. The same char acter will appear diﬀerent\\nin diﬀerent fonts. In Java, a font is characterized by a font n ame, a style, and a size. The\\navailable font names are system dependent, but you can alway s use the following four strings as\\nfont names: “Serif”, “SansSerif”, “Monospaced”, and “Dial og”. (A “serif” is a little decoration\\non a character, such as a short horizontal line at the bottom o f the letter i. “SansSerif” means\\n“without serifs.” “Monospaced” means that all the characte rs in the font have the same width.\\nThe “Dialog” font is the one that is typically used in dialog b oxes.)\\nThe style of a font is speciﬁed using named constants that are deﬁned in the Font class.\\nY ou can specify the style as one of the four values:\\n• Font.PLAIN,\\n• Font.ITALIC,\\n• Font.BOLD, or\\n• Font.BOLD + Font.ITALIC.\\nThe size of a font is an integer. Size typically ranges from ab out 10 to 36, although larger\\nsizes can also be used. The size of a font is usually about equa l to the height of the largest\\ncharacters in the font, in pixels, but this is not an exact rul e. The size of the default font is 12.'),\n",

GRAPHICS AND P AINTING 245\\nJava uses the class named java.awt.Font for representing fonts. Y ou can construct a new\\nfont by specifying its font name, style, and size in a constru ctor:\\nFont plainFont = new Font(\"Serif\", Font.PLAIN, 12);\\nFont bigBoldFont = new Font(\"SansSerif\", Font.BOLD, 24);\\nEvery graphics context has a current font, which is used for d rawing text. Y ou can change\\nthe current font with the setFont() method. F or example, if g is a graphics context and\\nbigBoldFont is a font, then the command g.setFont(bigBoldFont) will set the current font\\nof g to bigBoldFont. The new font will be used for any text that is drawn after the setFont()\\ncommand is given. Y ou can ﬁnd out the current font of g by calling the method g.getFont(),\\nwhich returns an object of type Font.\\nEvery component has an associated font. It can be set with the instance method\\nsetFont(font), which is deﬁned in the Component class. When a graphics context is cre-\\nated for drawing on a component, the graphic context’s curre nt font is set equal to the font of\\nthe component.\\n6.3.4 Shapes\\nThe Graphics class includes a large number of instance methods for drawin g various shapes,\\nsuch as lines, rectangles, and ovals. The shapes are speciﬁe d using the (x,y) coordinate system\\ndescribed above. They are drawn in the current drawing color of the graphics context. The\\ncurrent drawing color is set to the foreground color of the co mponent when the graphics context\\nis created, but it can be changed at any time using the setColor() method.\\nHere is a list of some of the most important drawing methods. W ith all these commands,\\nany drawing that is done outside the boundaries of the compon ent is ignored. Note that all\\nthese methods are in the Graphics class, so they all must be called through an object of type\\nGraphics.\\n• drawString(String str, int x, int y) — Draws the text given by the string str.\\nThe string is drawn using the current color and font of the gra phics context. x speciﬁes\\nthe position of the left end of the string. y is the y-coordinate of the baseline of the\\nstring. The baseline is a horizontal line on which the charac ters rest. Some parts of the\\ncharacters, such as the tail on a y or g, extend below the basel ine.\\n• drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) — Draws a line from the point (x1,y1)\\nto the point (x2,y2). The line is drawn as if with a pen that hangs one pixel to the\\nright and one pixel down from the (x,y) point where the pen is located. F or example, if\\ng refers to an object of type Graphics, then the command g.drawLine(x,y,x,y), which\\ncorresponds to putting the pen down at a point, colors the sin gle pixel with upper left\\ncorner at the point (x,y).\\n• drawRect(int x, int y, int width, int height) — Draws the outline of a rectangle.\\nThe upper left corner is at (x,y), and the width and height of the rectangle are as\\nspeciﬁed. If width equals height, then the rectangle is a square. If the width or the\\nheight is negative, then nothing is drawn. The rectangle is drawn wi th the same pen\\nthat is used for drawLine(). This means that the actual width of the rectangle as drawn\\nis width+1, and similarly for the height. There is an extra pixel along t he right edge and\\nthe bottom edge. F or example, if you want to draw a rectangle a round the edges of the\\ncomponent, you can say “ g.drawRect(0, 0, getWidth()-1, getHeight()-1);”, where\\ng is a graphics context for the component. If you use “ g.drawRect(0, 0, getWidth(),'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\ngetHeight());”, then the right and bottom edges of the rectangle will be dra wn outside\\nthe component.\\n• drawOval(int x, int y, int width, int height) — Draws the outline of an oval.\\nThe oval is one that just ﬁts inside the rectangle speciﬁed by x, y, width, and height. If\\nwidth equals height, the oval is a circle.\\n• drawRoundRect(int x, int y, int width, int height, int xdiam, int ydiam) —\\nDraws the outline of a rectangle with rounded corners. The ba sic rectangle is speciﬁed by\\nx, y, width, and height, but the corners are rounded. The degree of rounding is given by\\nxdiam and ydiam. The corners are arcs of an ellipse with horizontal diameter xdiam and\\nvertical diameter ydiam. A typical value for xdiam and ydiam is 16, but the value used\\nshould really depend on how big the rectangle is.\\n• draw3DRect(int x, int y, int width, int height, boolean raised) — Draws the\\noutline of a rectangle that is supposed to have a three-dimen sional eﬀect, as if it is raised\\nfrom the screen or pushed into the screen. The basic rectangl e is speciﬁed by x, y, width,\\nand height. The raised parameter tells whether the rectangle seems to be raised fro m the\\nscreen or pushed into it. The 3D eﬀect is achieved by using bri ghter and darker versions\\nof the drawing color for diﬀerent edges of the rectangle. The documentation recommends\\nsetting the drawing color equal to the background color befo re using this method. The\\neﬀect won’t work well for some colors.\\n• drawArc(int x, int y, int width, int height, int startAngle, int arcAngle) —\\nDraws part of the oval that just ﬁts inside the rectangle spec iﬁed by x, y, width, and\\nheight. The part drawn is an arc that extends arcAngle degrees from a starting angle\\nat startAngle degrees. Angles are measured with 0 degrees at the 3 o’clock p osition (the\\npositive direction of the horizontal axis). Positive angle s are measured counterclockwise\\nfrom zero, and negative angles are measured clockwise. T o ge t an arc of a circle, make\\nsure that width is equal to height.\\n• fillRect(int x, int y, int width, int height) — Draws a ﬁlled-in rectangle. This\\nﬁlls in the interior of the rectangle that would be drawn by drawRect(x,y,width,height).\\nThe extra pixel along the bottom and right edges is not includ ed. The width and\\nheight parameters give the exact width and height of the rectangle. F or example, if you\\nwanted to ﬁll in the entire component, you could say “ g.fillRect(0, 0, getWidth(),\\ngetHeight());”\\n• fillOval(int x, int y, int width, int height) — Draws a ﬁlled-in oval.\\n• fillRoundRect(int x, int y, int width, int height, int xdiam, int ydiam) —\\nDraws a ﬁlled-in rounded rectangle.\\n• fill3DRect(int x, int y, int width, int height, boolean raised) — Draws a\\nﬁlled-in three-dimensional rectangle.\\n• fillArc(int x, int y, int width, int height, int startAngle, int arcAngle) —\\nDraw a ﬁlled-in arc. This looks like a wedge of pie, whose crus t is the arc that would be\\ndrawn by the drawArc method.\\n6.3.5 Graphics2D\\nAll drawing in Java is done through an object of type Graphics. The Graphics class provides\\nbasic commands for such things as drawing shapes and text and for selecting a drawing color.'),\n",

GRAPHICS AND P AINTING 247\\nThese commands are adequate in many cases, but they fall far s hort of what’s needed in a\\nserious computer graphics program. Java has another class, Graphics2D, that provides a larger\\nset of drawing operations. Graphics2D is a sub-class of Graphics, so all the methods from the\\nGraphics class are also available in a Graphics2D.\\nThe paintComponent() method of a JComponent gives you a graphics context of type\\nGraphics that you can use for drawing on the component. In fact, the gra phics context actually\\nbelongs to the sub-class Graphics2D (in Java version 1.2 and later), and can be type-cast to\\ngain access to the advanced Graphics2D drawing methods:\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\\nsuper.paintComponent(g);\\nGraphics2D g2;\\ng2 = (Graphics2D)g;\\n.\\n. // Draw on the component using g2.\\n.\\n}\\nDrawing in Graphics2D is based on shapes, which are objects that implement an inter face\\nnamed Shape. Shape classes include Line2D, Rectangle2D, Ellipse2D, Arc2D, and CubicCurve2D,\\namong others; all these classes are deﬁned in the package java.awt.geom. CubicCurve2D can\\nbe used to draw Bezier Curves, which are used in many graphics programs. Graphics2D has\\nmethods draw(Shape) and fill(Shape) for drawing the outline of a shape and for ﬁlling its\\ninterior. Advanced capabilities include: lines that are mo re than one pixel thick, dotted and\\ndashed lines, ﬁlling a shape with a texture (this is, with a re peated image), ﬁlling a shape with\\na gradient, and drawing translucent objects that will blend with their background.\\nIn the Graphics class, coordinates are speciﬁed as integers and are based on pixels. The\\nshapes that are used with Graphics2D use real numbers for coordinates, and they are not neces-\\nsarily bound to pixels. In fact, you can change the coordinat e system and use any coordinates\\nthat are convenient to your application. In computer graphi cs terms, you can apply a “transfor-\\nmation” to the coordinate system. The transformation can be any combination of translation,\\nscaling, and rotation.\\nI mention Graphics2D here for completeness. I will not use any of the advanced capa bilities\\nof Graphics2D in this chapter, but I will cover a few of them in Section 12.2.\\n6.3.6 An Example\\nLet’s use some of the material covered in this section to writ e a subclass of JPanel for use as\\na drawing surface. The panel can then be used in either an appl et or a frame, as discussed in\\nSubsection 6.2.2. All the drawing will be done in the paintComponent() method of the panel\\nclass. The panel will draw multiple copies of a message on a bl ack background. Each copy of\\nthe message is in a random color. Five diﬀerent fonts are used , with diﬀerent sizes and styles.\\nThe message can be speciﬁed in the constructor; if the defaul t constructor is used, the message\\nis the string “Java!”. The panel works OK no matter what its si ze. Here is what the panel\\nlooks like:'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nThere is one problem with the way this class works. When the pa nel’s paintComponent()\\nmethod is called, it chooses random colors, fonts, and locat ions for the messages. The informa-\\ntion about which colors, fonts, and locations are used is not stored anywhere. The next time\\npaintComponent() is called, it will make diﬀerent random choices and will draw a diﬀerent\\npicture. F or this particular applet, the problem only reall y appears when the panel is partially\\ncovered and then uncovered (and even then the problem does no t show up in all environments).\\nIt is possible that only the part that was covered will be redr awn, and in the part that’s not\\nredrawn, the old picture will remain. The user might see part ial messages, cut oﬀ by the di-\\nviding line between the new picture and the old. A better appr oach would be to compute the\\ncontents of the picture elsewhere, outside the paintComponent() method. Information about\\nthe picture should be stored in instance variables, and the paintComponent() method should\\nuse that information to draw the picture. If paintComponent() is called twice, it should draw\\nthe same picture twice, unless the data has changed in the mea ntime. Unfortunately , to store\\nthe data for the picture in this applet, we would need to use ei ther arrays, which will not be\\ncovered until Chapter 7, or oﬀ-screen images, which will not be covered until Chapter 12. Other\\nexamples in this chapter will suﬀer from the same problem.\\nThe source for the panel class is shown below. I use an instanc e variable called message to\\nhold the message that the panel will display . There are ﬁve in stance variables of type Font that\\nrepresent diﬀerent sizes and styles of text. These variable s are initialized in the constructor and\\nare used in the paintComponent() method.\\nThe paintComponent() method for the panel simply draws 25 copies of the message. F o r\\neach copy , it chooses one of the ﬁve fonts at random, and it cal ls g.setFont() to select that\\nfont for drawing the text. It creates a random HSB color and us es g.setColor() to select that\\ncolor for drawing. It then chooses random (x,y) coordinates for the location of the message.\\nThe x coordinate gives the horizontal position of the left end of t he string. The formula used\\nfor the x coordinate, “ -50 + (int)(Math.random() * (width+40))” gives a random integer\\nin the range from -50 to width-10. This makes it possible for the string to extend beyond the\\nleft edge or the right edge of the panel. Similarly , the formu la for y allows the string to extend\\nbeyond the top and bottom of the applet.\\nHere is the complete source code for the RandomStringsPanel\\nimport java.awt.Color;\\nimport java.awt.Font;\\nimport java.awt.Graphics;\\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\\n/**\\n* This panel displays 25 copies of a message.

Y ou can ﬁnd the source code for a main prog ram that does this in the ﬁle\\nRandomStringsApp.java.\\n6.4 Mouse Events\\nEvents are central to programming for a graphical user interface. A GUI program doesn’t\\nhave a main() routine that outlines what will happen when the program is ru n, in a step-by-step\\nprocess from beginning to end. Instead, the program must be p repared to respond to various\\nkinds of events that can happen at unpredictable times and in an order that the program doesn’t\\ncontrol. The most basic kinds of events are generated by the m ouse and keyboard. The user\\ncan press any key on the keyboard, move the mouse, or press a bu tton on the mouse. The user\\ncan do any of these things at any time, and the computer has to r espond appropriately .\\nIn Java, events are represented by objects. When an event occ urs, the system collects all the\\ninformation relevant to the event and constructs an object t o contain that information. Diﬀerent\\ntypes of events are represented by objects belonging to diﬀe rent classes. F or example, when the\\nuser presses one of the buttons on a mouse, an object belongin g to a class called MouseEvent\\nis constructed. The object contains information such as the source of the event (that is, the\\ncomponent on which the user clicked), the (x,y) coordinates of the point in the component\\nwhere the click occurred, and which button on the mouse was pr essed. When the user presses a\\nkey on the keyboard, a KeyEvent is created. After the event object is constructed, it is pass ed\\nas a parameter to a designated subroutine. By writing that su broutine, the programmer says\\nwhat should happen when the event occurs.\\nAs a Java programmer, you get a fairly high-level view of even ts. There is a lot of processing\\nthat goes on between the time that the user presses a key or mov es the mouse and the time that\\na subroutine in your program is called to respond to the event . F ortunately , you don’t need to\\nknow much about that processing. But you should understand t his much: Even though your\\nGUI program doesn’t have a main() routine, there is a sort of main routine running somewhere\\nthat executes a loop of the form\\nwhile the program is still running:\\nWait for the next event to occur\\nCall a subroutine to handle the event'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nThis loop is called an event loop . Every GUI program has an event loop. In Java, you\\ndon’t have to write the loop. It’s part of “the system.” If you write a GUI program in some\\nother language, you might have to provide a main routine that runs an event loop.\\nIn this section, we’ll look at handling mouse events in Java, and we’ll cover the framework\\nfor handling events in general. The next section will cover k eyboard-related events and timer\\nevents. Java also has other types of events, which are produc ed by GUI components. These\\nwill be introduced in Section 6.6.\\n6.4.1 Event Handling\\nF or an event to have any eﬀect, a program must detect the event and react to it. In order to\\ndetect an event, the program must “listen” for it. Listening for events is something that is done\\nby an object called an event listener . An event listener object must contain instance methods\\nfor handling the events for which it listens. F or example, if an object is to serve as a listener for\\nevents of type MouseEvent, then it must contain the following method (among several ot hers):\\npublic void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\nThe body of the method deﬁnes how the object responds when it i s notiﬁed that a mouse button\\nhas been pressed. The parameter, evt, contains information about the event. This information\\ncan be used by the listener object to determine its response.\\nThe methods that are required in a mouse event listener are sp eciﬁed in an interface\\nnamed MouseListener. T o be used as a listener for mouse events, an object must impl ement\\nthis MouseListener interface. Java interfaces were covered in Subsection 5.7.1. (T o review\\nbrieﬂy: An interface in Java is just a list of instance methods. A class can “implem ent” an\\ninterface by doing two things. First, the class must be decla red to implement the interface, as\\nin “ class MyListener implements MouseListener” or “ class MyApplet extends JApplet\\nimplements MouseListener”. Second, the class must include a deﬁnition for each instan ce\\nmethod speciﬁed in the interface. An interface can be used as the type for a variable or\\nformal parameter. W e say that an object implements the MouseListener interface if it belongs\\nto a class that implements the MouseListener interface. Note that it is not enough for the object\\nto include the speciﬁed methods. It must also belong to a clas s that is speciﬁcally declared to\\nimplement the interface.)\\nMany events in Java are associated with GUI components. F or e xample, when the user\\npresses a button on the mouse, the associated component is th e one that the user clicked\\non. Before a listener object can “hear” events associated wi th a given component, the lis-\\ntener object must be registered with the component. If a MouseListener object, mListener,\\nneeds to hear mouse events associated with a Component object, comp, the listener must be\\nregistered with the component by calling “ comp.addMouseListener(mListener);”. The\\naddMouseListener() method is an instance method in class Component, and so can be used\\nwith any GUI component object. In our ﬁrst few examples, we wi ll listen for events on a JPanel\\nthat is being used as a drawing surface.\\nThe event classes, such as MouseEvent, and the listener interfaces, such as MouseListener, are\\ndeﬁned in the package java.awt.event. This means that if you want to work with events, you\\nshould either include the line “ import java.awt.event.*;” at the beginning of your source\\ncode ﬁle or import the individual classes and interfaces.\\nAdmittedly , there is a large number of details to tend to when you want to use events. T o\\nsummarize, you must'),\n",

Register the listener object with the component that will ge nerate the events by calling\\na method such as addMouseListener() in the component.\\nAny object can act as an event listener, provided that it impl ements the appropriate in-\\nterface. A component can listen for the events that it itself generates. A panel can listen for\\nevents from components that are contained in the panel. A spe cial class can be created just\\nfor the purpose of deﬁning a listening object. Many people co nsider it to be good form to use\\nanonymous inner classes to deﬁne listening objects (see Sub section 5.7.3). Y ou will see all of\\nthese patterns in examples in this textbook.\\n6.4.2 MouseEvent and MouseListener\\nThe MouseListener interface speciﬁes ﬁve diﬀerent instance methods:\\npublic void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt);\\npublic void mouseReleased(MouseEvent evt);\\npublic void mouseClicked(MouseEvent evt);\\npublic void mouseEntered(MouseEvent evt);\\npublic void mouseExited(MouseEvent evt);\\nThe mousePressed method is called as soon as the user presses down on one of the m ouse\\nbuttons, and mouseReleased is called when the user releases a button. These are the two\\nmethods that are most commonly used, but any mouse listener o bject must deﬁne all ﬁve\\nmethods; you can leave the body of a method empty if you don’t w ant to deﬁne a response. The\\nmouseClicked method is called if the user presses a mouse button and then re leases it quickly ,\\nwithout moving the mouse. (When the user does this, all three routines— mousePressed,\\nmouseReleased, and mouseClicked—will be called in that order.) In most cases, you should\\ndeﬁne mousePressed instead of mouseClicked. The mouseEntered and mouseExited methods\\nare called when the mouse cursor enters or leaves the compone nt. F or example, if you want the\\ncomponent to change appearance whenever the user moves the m ouse over the component, you\\ncould deﬁne these two methods.\\nAs an example, we will look at a small addition to the RandomStringsPanel example from\\nthe previous section. In the new version, the panel will repa int itself when the user clicks on it.\\nIn order for this to happen, a mouse listener should listen fo r mouse events on the panel, and\\nwhen the listener detects a mousePressed event, it should respond by calling the repaint()\\nmethod of the panel.\\nF or the new version of the program, we need an object that impl ements the MouseListener\\ninterface. One way to create the object is to deﬁne a separate class, such as:\\nimport java.awt.Component;\\nimport java.awt.event.*;\\n/**\\n* An object of type RepaintOnClick is a MouseListener that\\n* will respond to a mousePressed event by calling the repaint()\\n* method of the source of the event.

Second, it is\\ndeclared that the class “ implements MouseListener”. And third, it provides deﬁnitions for\\nthe ﬁve methods that are speciﬁed in the MouseListener interface. (Note that four of the ﬁve\\nevent-handling methods have empty deﬁntions. W e really onl y want to deﬁne a response to\\nmousePressed events, but in order to implement the MouseListener interface, a class must\\ndeﬁne all ﬁve methods.)\\nW e must do one more thing to set up the event handling for this e xample: W e must register\\nan event-handling object as a listener with the component th at will generate the events. In\\nthis case, the mouse events that we are interested in will be g enerated by an object of type\\nRandomStringsPanel. If panel is a variable that refers to the panel object, we can create a\\nmouse listener object and register it with the panel with the statements:\\nRepaintOnClick listener = new RepaintOnClick(); // Create MouseListener object.\\npanel.addMouseListener(listener); // Register MouseLis tener with the panel.\\nOnce this is done, the listener object will be notiﬁed of mouse events on the panel. When a\\nmousePressed event occurs, the mousePressed() method in the listener will be called. The\\ncode in this method calls the repaint() method in the component that is the source of the\\nevent, that is, in the panel. The result is that the RandomStringsPanel is repainted with its\\nstrings in new random colors, fonts, and positions.\\nAlthough we have written the RepaintOnClick class for use with our RandomStringsPanel\\nexample, the event-handling class contains no reference at all to the RandomStringsPanel class.\\nHow can this be? The mousePressed() method in class RepaintOnClick looks at the source\\nof the event, and calls its repaint() method. If we have registered the RepaintOnClick object\\nas a listener on a RandomStringsPanel, then it is that panel that is repainted. But the listener\\nobject could be used with any type of component, and it would w ork in the same way .\\nSimilarly , the RandomStringsPanel class contains no reference to the RepaintOnClick class—\\nin fact, RandomStringsPanel was written before we even knew anything about mouse events!\\nThe panel will send mouse events to any object that has regist ered with it as a mouse listener.\\nIt does not need to know anything about that object except tha t it is capable of receiving mouse\\nevents.\\nThe relationship between an object that generates an event a nd an object that responds\\nto that event is rather loose. The relationship is set up by re gistering one object to listen for'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\n6.4.3 Mouse Coordinates\\nOften, when a mouse event occurs, you want to know the locatio n of the mouse cursor. This\\ninformation is available from the MouseEvent parameter to the event-handling method, which\\ncontains instance methods that return information about th e event. If evt is the parame-\\nter, then you can ﬁnd out the coordinates of the mouse cursor b y calling evt.getX() and\\nevt.getY(). These methods return integers which give the x and y coordinates where the\\nmouse cursor was positioned at the time when the event occurr ed. The coordinates are ex-\\npressed in the coordinate system of the component that gener ated the event, where the top left\\ncorner of the component is (0,0).\\nThe user can hold down certain modiﬁer keys while using the mouse. The possible mod-\\niﬁer keys include: the Shift key , the Control key , the AL T key (called the Option key on the\\nMacintosh), and the Meta key (called the Command or Apple key on the Macintosh). Y ou\\nmight want to respond to a mouse event diﬀerently when the use r is holding down a modi-\\nﬁer key . The boolean-valued instance methods evt.isShiftDown(), evt.isControlDown(),\\nevt.isAltDown(), and evt.isMetaDown() can be called to test whether the modiﬁer keys are\\npressed.\\nY ou might also want to have diﬀerent responses depending on w hether the user presses\\nthe left mouse button, the middle mouse button, or the right m ouse button. Now, not every\\nmouse has a middle button and a right button, so Java handles t he information in a peculiar\\nway . It treats pressing the right button as equivalent to hol ding down the Meta key while\\npressing the left mouse button. That is, if the right button i s pressed, then the instance\\nmethod evt.isMetaDown() will return true (even if the Meta key is not pressed). Similarly ,\\npressing the middle mouse button is equivalent to holding do wn the AL T key . In practice,\\nwhat this really means is that pressing the right mouse butto n under Windows is equivalent to\\nholding down the Command key while pressing the mouse button on Macintosh. A program\\ntests for either of these by calling evt.isMetaDown().\\nAs an example, consider a JPanel that does the following: Clicking on the panel with the left\\nmouse button will place a red rectangle on the panel at the poi nt where the mouse was clicked.\\nClicking with the right mouse button (or holding down the Com mand key while clicking on a\\nMacintosh) will place a blue oval on the applet. Holding down the Shift key while clicking will\\nclear the panel by removing all the shapes that have been plac ed.\\nThere are several ways to write this example. I could write a s eparate class to handle\\nmouse events, as I did in the previous example. However, in th is case, I decided to let the\\npanel respond to mouse events itself. Any object can be a mous e listener, as long as it imple-\\nments the MouseListener interface. In this case, the panel class implements the MouseListener\\ninterface, so any object belonging to that class can act as a m ouse listener. The constructor\\nfor the panel class registers the panel with itself as a mouse listener. It does this with the\\nstatement “ addMouseListener(this)”. Since this command is in a method in the panel class,\\nthe addMouseListener() method in the panel object is being called, and a listener is b eing\\nregistered with that panel. The parameter “ this” also refers to the panel object, so it is the\\nsame panel object that is listening for events. Thus, the pan el object plays a dual role here. (If\\nyou ﬁnd this too confusing, remember that you can always writ e a separate class to deﬁne the\\nlistening object.)\\nThe source code for the panel class is shown below. Y ou should check how the instance\\nmethods in the MouseEvent object are used. Y ou can also check for the F our Steps of Event\\nHandling (“ import java.awt.event.*”, “ implements MouseListener”, deﬁnitions for the\\nevent-handling methods, and “ addMouseListener”):'),\n",

I do n ot advise doing this type of direct\\ndrawing if it can be avoided, but you can see that it does work i n this case, and at this point\\nwe really have no other way to write this example.\\n6.4.4 MouseMotionListeners and Dragging\\nWhenever the mouse is moved, it generates events. The operat ing system of the computer\\ndetects these events and uses them to move the mouse cursor on the screen. It is also possible\\nfor a program to listen for these “mouse motion” events and re spond to them. The most\\ncommon reason to do so is to implement dragging. Dragging occurs when the user moves the\\nmouse while holding down a mouse button.\\nThe methods for responding to mouse motion events are deﬁned in an interface named\\nMouseMotionListener. This interface speciﬁes two event-handling methods:\\npublic void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt);\\npublic void mouseMoved(MouseEvent evt);\\nThe mouseDragged method is called if the mouse is moved while a button on the mou se\\nis pressed. If the mouse is moved while no mouse button is down , then mouseMoved is called\\ninstead. The parameter, evt, is an object of type MouseEvent. It contains the x and y coordi-\\nnates of the mouse’s location. As long as the user continues t o move the mouse, one of these\\nmethods will be called over and over. (So many events are gene rated that it would be ineﬃcient\\nfor a program to hear them all, if it doesn’t want to do anythin g in response. This is why the\\nmouse motion event-handlers are deﬁned in a separate interf ace from the other mouse events:\\nY ou can listen for the mouse events deﬁned in MouseListener without automatically hearing all\\nmouse motion events as well.)'),\n",

MOUSE EVENTS 259\\nIf you want your program to respond to mouse motion events, yo u must create an object that\\nimplements the MouseMotionListener interface, and you must register that object to listen for\\nevents. The registration is done by calling a component’s addMouseMotionListener method.\\nThe object will then listen for mouseDragged and mouseMoved events associated with that\\ncomponent. In most cases, the listener object will also impl ement the MouseListener interface\\nso that it can respond to the other mouse events as well.\\nT o get a better idea of how mouse events work, you should try th e SimpleT rackMouseApplet\\nin the on-line version of this section. The applet is program med to respond to any of the seven\\ndiﬀerent kinds of mouse events by displaying the coordinate s of the mouse, the type of event, and\\na list of the modiﬁer keys that are down (Shift, Control, Meta , and Alt). Y ou can experiment\\nwith the applet to see what happens when you use the mouse on th e applet. (Alternatively ,\\nyou could run the stand-alone application version of the pro gram, SimpleTrackMouse.java.)\\nThe source code for the applet can be found in SimpleTrackMousePanel.java, which deﬁnes\\nthe panel that is used as the content pane of the applet, and in SimpleTrackMouseApplet.java,\\nwhich deﬁnes the applet class. The panel class includes a nes ted class, MouseHandler, that\\ndeﬁnes the mouse-handling object. I encourage you to read th e source code. Y ou should now\\nbe familiar with all the techniques that it uses.\\nIt is interesting to look at what a program needs to do in order to respond to dragging op-\\nerations. In general, the response involves three methods: mousePressed(), mouseDragged(),\\nand mouseReleased(). The dragging gesture starts when the user presses a mouse bu tton,\\nit continues while the mouse is dragged, and it ends when the u ser releases the button. This\\nmeans that the programming for the response to one dragging g esture must be spread out over\\nthe three methods! F urthermore, the mouseDragged() method can be called many times as\\nthe mouse moves. T o keep track of what is going on between one m ethod call and the next,\\nyou need to set up some instance variables. In many applicati ons, for example, in order to\\nprocess a mouseDragged event, you need to remember the previous coordinates of the m ouse.\\nY ou can store this information in two instance variables prevX and prevY of type int. It can\\nalso be useful to save the starting coordinates, where the mousePressed event occurred, in\\ninstance variables. I also suggest having a boolean variable, dragging, which is set to true\\nwhile a dragging gesture is being processed. This is necessa ry because not every mousePressed\\nevent starts a dragging operation to which you want to respon d. The mouseDragged and\\nmouseReleased methods can use the value of dragging to check whether a drag operation is\\nactually in progress. Y ou might need other instance variabl es as well, but in general outline, a\\nclass that handles mouse dragging looks like this:\\nimport java.awt.event.*;\\npublic class MouseDragHandler implements MouseListener, MouseMotionListener {\\nprivate int startX, startY; // Point where mouse is pressed.\\nprivate int prevX, prevY; // Most recently processed mouse c oords.\\nprivate boolean dragging; // Set to true when dragging is in p rocess.\\n. . . // other instance variables for use in dragging\\npublic void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) {\\nif ( we-want-to-start-dragging ) {\\ndragging = true;\\nstartX = evt.getX(); // Remember starting position.\\nstartY = evt.getY();\\nprevX = startX; // Remember most recent coords.\\nprevY = startY;'),\n",

The main() routine has nothing to do with the class’s use as an applet, bu t it makes it\\npossible to run the class as a stand-alone application. When this is done, the application opens\\na window that shows the same panel that would be shown in the ap plet version. This example\\nthus shows how to write a single ﬁle that can be used either as a stand-alone application or as\\nan applet.)\\nThe panel class for this example is designed to work for any re asonable size, that is, unless\\nthe panel is too small. This means that coordinates are compu ted in terms of the actual\\nwidth and height of the panel. (The width and height are obtai ned by calling getWidth() and\\ngetHeight().) This makes things quite a bit harder than they would be if we assumed some\\nparticular ﬁxed size for the panel. Let’s look at some of thes e computations in detail. F or\\nexample, the large white drawing area extends from y = 3 to y = height - 3 vertically and\\nfrom x = 3 to x = width - 56 horizontally . These numbers are needed in order to interpre t\\nthe meaning of a mouse click. They take into account a gray bor der around the panel and\\nthe color palette along the right edge of the panel. The borde r is 3 pixels wide. The colored\\nrectangles are 50 pixels wide. T ogether with the 3-pixel bor der around the panel and a 3-pixel\\ndivider between the drawing area and the colored rectangles , this adds up to put the right edge\\nof the drawing area 56 pixels from the right edge of the panel.\\nA white square labeled “ CLEAR” occupies a 50-by-50 pixel region beneath the colored rect-\\nangles on the right edge of the panel. Allowing for this squar e, we can ﬁgure out how much\\nvertical space is available for the seven colored rectangle s, and then divide that space by 7 to\\nget the vertical space available for each rectangle. This qu antity is represented by a variable,\\ncolorSpace. Out of this space, 3 pixels are used as spacing between the re ctangles, so the height\\nof each rectangle is colorSpace - 3. The top of the N-th rectangle is located (N*colorSpace\\n+ 3) pixels down from the top of the panel, assuming that we count t he rectangles starting\\nwith zero. This is because there are N rectangles above the N-th rectangle, each of which uses\\ncolorSpace pixels. The extra 3 is for the border at the top of the panel. Af ter all that, we can\\nwrite down the command for drawing the N-th rectangle:\\ng.fillRect(width - 53, N*colorSpace + 3, 50, colorSpace - 3);\\nThat was not easy! But it shows the kind of careful thinking an d precision graphics that are\\nsometimes necessary to get good results.\\nThe mouse in this panel is used to do three diﬀerent things: Se lect a color, clear the drawing,\\nand draw a curve. Only the third of these involves dragging, s o not every mouse click will start\\na dragging operation. The mousePressed routine has to look at the (x,y) coordinates where\\nthe mouse was clicked and decide how to respond. If the user cl icked on the CLEAR rectangle,\\nthe drawing area is cleared by calling repaint(). If the user clicked somewhere in the strip\\nof colored rectangles, the selected color is changed. This i nvolves computing which color the\\nuser clicked on, which is done by dividing the y coordinate by colorSpace. Finally , if the user\\nclicked on the drawing area, a drag operation is initiated. A boolean variable, dragging, is\\nset to true so that the mouseDragged and mouseReleased methods will know that a curve is\\nbeing drawn. The code for this follows the general form given above. The actual drawing of\\nthe curve is done in the mouseDragged method, which draws a line from the previous location\\nof the mouse to its current location. Some eﬀort is required t o make sure that the line does\\nnot extend beyond the white drawing area of the panel. This is not automatic, since as far as\\nthe computer is concerned, the border and the color bar are pa rt of the drawing surface. If the'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nuser drags the mouse outside the drawing area while drawing a line, the mouseDragged routine\\nchanges the x and y coordinates to make them lie within the drawing area.\\n6.4.5 Anonymous Event Handlers\\nAs I mentioned above, it is a fairly common practice to use ano nymous nested classes to deﬁne\\nlistener objects. As discussed in Subsection 5.7.3, a speci al form of the new operator is used to\\ncreate an object that belongs to an anonymous class. F or exam ple, a mouse listener object can\\nbe created with an expression of the form:\\nnew MouseListener() {\\npublic void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\npublic void mouseReleased(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\npublic void mouseClicked(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\npublic void mouseEntered(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\npublic void mouseExited(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\n}\\nThis is all just one long expression that both deﬁnes an un-na med class and creates an object\\nthat belongs to that class. T o use the object as a mouse listen er, it should be passed as the\\nparameter to some component’s addMouseListener() method in a command of the form:\\ncomponent.addMouseListener( new MouseListener() {\\npublic void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\npublic void mouseReleased(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\npublic void mouseClicked(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\npublic void mouseEntered(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\npublic void mouseExited(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\n} );\\nNow, in a typical application, most of the method deﬁnitions in this class will be empty .\\nA class that implements an interface must provide deﬁnitions for all the methods in that\\ninterface, even if the deﬁnitions are empty . T o avoid the ted ium of writing empty method\\ndeﬁnitions in cases like this, Java provides adapter classes . An adapter class implements\\na listener interface by providing empty deﬁnitions for all t he methods in the interface. An\\nadapter class is useful only as a basis for making subclasses . In the subclass, you can deﬁne just\\nthose methods that you actually want to use. F or the remainin g methods, the empty deﬁnitions\\nthat are provided by the adapter class will be used. The adapt er class for the MouseListener\\ninterface is named MouseAdapter. F or example, if you want a mouse listener that only responds\\nto mouse-pressed events, you can use a command of the form:\\ncomponent.addMouseListener( new MouseAdapter() {\\npublic void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\n} );\\nT o see how this works in a real example, let’s write another ve rsion of the\\nClickableRandomStringsApp application from Subsection 6.4.2. This version uses an ano ny-\\nmous class based on MouseAdapter to handle mouse events:\\nimport java.awt.Component;\\nimport java.awt.event.MouseEvent;\\nimport java.awt.event.MouseListener;\\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\\npublic class ClickableRandomStringsApp {'),\n",

Events can al so be\\ngenerated by objects as part of their regular programming, a nd these events can be monitored\\nby other objects so that they can take appropriate actions wh en the events occur. One example\\nof this is the class javax.swing.Timer. A Timer generates events at regular intervals. These\\nevents can be used to drive an animation or to perform some oth er task at regular intervals.\\nW e will begin this section with a look at timer events and anim ation. W e will then look at\\nanother type of basic user-generated event: the KeyEvents that are generated when the user\\ntypes on the keyboard. The example at the end of the section us es both a timer and keyboard\\nevents to implement a simple game.\\n6.5.1 Timers and Animation\\nAn object belonging to the class javax.swing.Timer exists only to generate events. A Timer,\\nby default, generates a sequence of events with a ﬁxed delay b etween each event and the next.\\n(It is also possible to set a Timer to emit a single event after a speciﬁed time delay; in that cas e,\\nthe timer is being used as an “alarm.”) Each event belongs to t he class ActionEvent. An object\\nthat is to listen for the events must implement the interface ActionListener, which deﬁnes just\\none method:\\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)\\nT o use a Timer, you must create an object that implements the ActionListener interface. That\\nis, the object must belong to a class that is declared to “ implement ActionListener”, and\\nthat class must deﬁne the actionPerformed method. Then, if the object is set to listen for'),\n",

TIMER AND KEYBOARD EVENTS 265\\nevents from the timer, the code in the listener’s actionPerformed method will be executed\\nevery time the timer generates an event.\\nSince there is no point to having a timer without having a list ener to respond to its events,\\nthe action listener for a timer is speciﬁed as a parameter in t he timer’s constructor. The time\\ndelay between timer events is also speciﬁed in the construct or. If timer is a variable of type\\nTimer, then the statement\\ntimer = new Timer( millisDelay, listener );\\ncreates a timer with a delay of millisDelay milliseconds between events (where 1000 mil-\\nliseconds equal one second). Events from the timer are sent t o the listener. ( millisDelay\\nmust be of type int, and listener must be of type ActionListener.) Note that a timer is not\\nguaranteed to deliver events at precisely regular interval s. If the computer is busy with some\\nother task, an event might be delayed or even dropped altoget her.\\nA timer does not automatically start generating events when the timer object is created.\\nThe start() method in the timer must be called to tell the timer to start ge nerating events.\\nThe timer’s stop() method can be used to turn the stream of events oﬀ—it can be res tarted\\nby calling start() again.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nOne application of timers is computer animation. A computer animation is just a sequence\\nof still images, presented to the user one after the other. If the time between images is short,\\nand if the change from one image to another is not too great, th en the user perceives continuous\\nmotion. The easiest way to do animation in Java is to use a Timer to drive the animation. Each\\ntime the timer generates an event, the next frame of the anima tion is computed and drawn on\\nthe screen—the code that implements this goes in the actionPerformed method of an object\\nthat listens for events from the timer.\\nOur ﬁrst example of using a timer is not exactly an animation, but it does display a new\\nimage for each timer event. The program shows randomly gener ated images that vaguely\\nresemble works of abstract art. In fact, the program draws a n ew random image every time\\nits paintComponent() method is called, and the response to a timer event is simply t o call\\nrepaint(), which in turn triggers a call to paintComponent. The work of the program is done\\nin a subclass of JPanel, which starts like this:\\nimport java.awt.*;\\nimport java.awt.event.*;\\nimport javax.swing.*;\\npublic class RandomArtPanel extends JPanel {\\n/**\\n* A RepaintAction object calls the repaint method of this panel each\\n* time its actionPerformed() method is called.

The result is that the pane l is\\n* redrawn every four seconds.\\n*/\\nprivate class RepaintAction implements ActionListener {\\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {\\nrepaint(); // Call the repaint() method in the panel class.\\n}\\n}'),\n",

These event s are associated with GUI\\ncomponents. When the user presses a button on the mouse, the e vent that is generated is\\nassociated with the component that contains the mouse curso r. What about keyboard events?\\nWhen the user presses a key , what component is associated wit h the key event that is generated?\\nA GUI uses the idea of input focus to determine the component associated with keyboard\\nevents. At any given time, exactly one interface element on t he screen has the input focus,\\nand that is where all keyboard events are directed. If the int erface element happens to be a\\nJava component, then the information about the keyboard eve nt becomes a Java object of type\\nKeyEvent, and it is delivered to any listener objects that are listeni ng for KeyEvents associated\\nwith that component. The necessity of managing input focus a dds an extra twist to working\\nwith keyboard events.\\nIt’s a good idea to give the user some visual feedback about wh ich component has the input\\nfocus. F or example, if the component is the typing area of a wo rd-processor, the feedback is\\nusually in the form of a blinking text cursor. Another common visual clue is to draw a brightly\\ncolored border around the edge of a component when it has the i nput focus, as I do in the\\nexamples given later in this section.\\nA component that wants to have the input focus can call the met hod requestFocus(),\\nwhich is deﬁned in the Component class. Calling this method does not absolutely guarantee\\nthat the component will actually get the input focus. Severa l components might request the\\nfocus; only one will get it. This method should only be used in certain circumstances in any\\ncase, since it can be a rude surprise to the user to have the foc us suddenly pulled away from\\na component that the user is working with. In a typical user in terface, the user can choose to'),\n",

TIMER AND KEYBOARD EVENTS 267\\ngive the focus to a component by clicking on that component wi th the mouse. And pressing\\nthe tab key will often move the focus from one component to ano ther.\\nSome components do not automatically request the input focu s when the user clicks on\\nthem. T o solve this problem, a program has to register a mouse listener with the compo-\\nnent to detect user clicks. In response to a user click, the mousePressed() method should\\ncall requestFocus() for the component. This is true, in particular, for the compo nents that\\nare used as drawing surfaces in the examples in this chapter. These components are deﬁned\\nas subclasses of JPanel, and JPanel objects do not receive the input focus automatically . If\\nyou want to be able to use the keyboard to interact with a JPanel named drawingSurface,\\nyou have to register a listener to listen for mouse events on t he drawingSurface and call\\ndrawingSurface.requestFocus() in the mousePressed() method of the listener object.\\nAs our ﬁrst example of processing key events, we look at a simp le program in which the\\nuser moves a square up, down, left, and right by pressing arro w keys. When the user hits the\\n’R’, ’G’, ’B’, or ’K’ key , the color of the square is set to red, green, blue, or black, respectively .\\nOf course, none of these key events are delivered to the progr am unless it has the input focus.\\nThe panel in the program changes its appearance when it has th e input focus: When it does,\\na cyan-colored border is drawn around the panel; when it does not, a gray-colored border is\\ndrawn. Also, the panel displays a diﬀerent message in each ca se. If the panel does not have the\\ninput focus, the user can give the input focus to the panel by c licking on it. The complete source\\ncode for this example can be found in the ﬁle KeyboardAndFocusDemo.java. I will discuss some\\naspects of it below. After reading this section, you should b e able to understand the source\\ncode in its entirety . Here is what the program looks like in it s focussed state:\\nIn Java, keyboard event objects belong to a class called KeyEvent. An object that needs to\\nlisten for KeyEvents must implement the interface named KeyListener. F urthermore, the object\\nmust be registered with a component by calling the component ’s addKeyListener() method.\\nThe registration is done with the command “ component.addKeyListener(listener);” where\\nlistener is the object that is to listen for key events, and component is the object that will\\ngenerate the key events (when it has the input focus). It is po ssible for component and listener\\nto be the same object. All this is, of course, directly analog ous to what you learned about mouse\\nevents in the previous section. The KeyListener interface deﬁnes the following methods, which\\nmust be included in any class that implements KeyListener :\\npublic void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt);\\npublic void keyReleased(KeyEvent evt);\\npublic void keyTyped(KeyEvent evt);\\nJava makes a careful distinction between the keys that you press and the characters that\\nyou type . There are lots of keys on a keyboard: letter keys, number key s, modiﬁer keys such\\nas Control and Shift, arrow keys, page up and page down keys, k eypad keys, function keys. In'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nmany cases, pressing a key does not type a character. On the ot her hand, typing a character\\nsometimes involves pressing several keys. F or example, to t ype an uppercase ’A’, you have to\\npress the Shift key and then press the A key before releasing t he Shift key . On my Macintosh\\ncomputer, I can type an accented e, by holding down the Option key , pressing the E key ,\\nreleasing the Option key , and pressing E again. Only one char acter was typed, but I had to\\nperform three key-presses and I had to release a key at the rig ht time. In Java, there are\\nthree types of KeyEvent. The types correspond to pressing a key , releasing a key , and typing\\na character. The keyPressed method is called when the user presses a key , the keyReleased\\nmethod is called when the user releases a key , and the keyTyped method is called when the user\\ntypes a character. Note that one user action, such as pressin g the E key , can be responsible for\\ntwo events, a keyPressed event and a keyTyped event. Typing an upper case ’A’ can generate\\ntwo keyPressed, two keyReleased, and one keyTyped event.\\nUsually , it is better to think in terms of two separate stream s of events, one consisting of\\nkeyPressed and keyReleased events and the other consisting of keyTyped events. F or some\\napplications, you want to monitor the ﬁrst stream; for other applications, you want to monitor\\nthe second one. Of course, the information in the keyTyped stream could be extracted from\\nthe keyPressed/keyReleased stream, but it would be diﬃcult (and also system-dependent\\nto some extent). Some user actions, such as pressing the Shif t key , can only be detected as\\nkeyPressed events. I have a solitaire game on my computer that hilites ev ery card that can be\\nmoved, when I hold down the Shift key . Y ou could do something l ike that in Java by hiliting\\nthe cards when the Shift key is pressed and removing the hilit e when the Shift key is released.\\nThere is one more complication. Usually , when you hold down a key on the keyboard, that\\nkey will auto-repeat. This means that it will generate multiple keyPressed events, as long\\nas it is held down. It can also generate multiple keyTyped events. F or the most part, this will\\nnot aﬀect your programming, but you should not expect every keyPressed event to have a\\ncorresponding keyReleased event.\\nEvery key on the keyboard has an integer code number. (Actual ly , this is only true\\nfor keys that Java knows about. Many keyboards have extra key s that can’t be used with\\nJava.) When the keyPressed or keyReleased method is called, the parameter, evt, contains\\nthe code of the key that was pressed or released. The code can b e obtained by calling the\\nfunction evt.getKeyCode(). Rather than asking you to memorize a table of code numbers,\\nJava provides a named constant for each key . These constants are deﬁned in the KeyEvent\\nclass. F or example the constant for the shift key is KeyEvent.VK SHIFT. If you want to test\\nwhether the key that the user pressed is the Shift key , you cou ld say “ if (evt.getKeyCode()\\n== KeyEvent.VK SHIFT)”. The key codes for the four arrow keys are KeyEvent.VK LEFT,\\nKeyEvent.VK RIGHT, KeyEvent.VK UP, and KeyEvent.VK DOWN. Other keys have similar codes.\\n(The “VK” stands for “Virtual Keyboard”. In reality , diﬀere nt keyboards use diﬀerent key\\ncodes, but Java translates the actual codes from the keyboar d into its own “virtual” codes.\\nY our program only sees these virtual key codes, so it will wor k with various keyboards on\\nvarious platforms without modiﬁcation.)\\nIn the case of a keyTyped event, you want to know which character was typed. This\\ninformation can be obtained from the parameter, evt, in the keyTyped method by calling\\nthe function evt.getKeyChar(). This function returns a value of type char representing the\\ncharacter that was typed.\\nIn the KeyboardAndFocusDemo program, I use the keyPressed routine to respond when the\\nuser presses one of the arrow keys. The applet includes insta nce variables, squareLeft and\\nsquareTop, that give the position of the upper left corner of the movabl e square. When the'),\n",

In Java, objects are notiﬁed about changes of input focus by events\\nof type FocusEvent. An object that wants to be notiﬁed of changes in focus can imp lement the\\nFocusListener interface. This interface declares two methods:'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\npublic void focusGained(FocusEvent evt);\\npublic void focusLost(FocusEvent evt);\\nF urthermore, the addFocusListener() method must be used to set up a listener for the\\nfocus events. When a component gets the input focus, it calls the focusGained() method of\\nany object that has been registered with that component as a FocusListener. When it loses the\\nfocus, it calls the listener’s focusLost() method. Sometimes, it is the component itself that\\nlistens for focus events.\\nIn the sample KeyboardAndFocusDemo program, the response to a focus event is simply\\nto redraw the panel. The paintComponent() method checks whether the panel has the input\\nfocus by calling the boolean-valued function hasFocus(), which is deﬁned in the Component\\nclass, and it draws a diﬀerent picture depending on whether o r not the panel has the input\\nfocus. The net result is that the appearance of the panel chan ges when the panel gains or loses\\nfocus. The methods from the FocusListener interface are deﬁned simply as:\\npublic void focusGained(FocusEvent evt) {\\n// The panel now has the input focus.\\nrepaint(); // will redraw with a new message and a cyan border\\n}\\npublic void focusLost(FocusEvent evt) {\\n// The panel has now lost the input focus.\\nrepaint(); // will redraw with a new message and a gray border\\n}\\nThe other aspect of handling focus is to make sure that the panel gets the focus when the\\nuser clicks on it. T o do this, the panel implements the MouseListener interface and listens for\\nmouse events on itself. It deﬁnes a mousePressed routine that asks that the input focus be\\ngiven to the panel:\\npublic void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) {\\nrequestFocus();\\n}\\nThe other four methods of the mouseListener interface are deﬁned to be empty . Note that the\\npanel implements three diﬀerent listener interfaces, KeyListener, FocusListener, and MouseLis-\\ntener, and the constructor in the panel class registers itself to l isten for all three types of events\\nwith the statements:\\naddKeyListener(this);\\naddFocusListener(this);\\naddMouseListener(this);\\nThere are, of course, other ways to organize this example. It would be possible, for example, to\\nuse a nested class to deﬁne the listening object. Or anonymou s classes could be used to deﬁne\\nseparate listening objects for each type of event. In my next example, I will take the latter\\napproach.\\n6.5.4 State Machines\\nThe information stored in an object’s instance variables is said to represent the state of that\\nobject. When one of the object’s methods is called, the actio n taken by the object can depend\\non its state. (Or, in the terminology we have been using, the d eﬁnition of the method can look\\nat the instance variables to decide what to do.) F urthermore , the state can change. (That'),\n",

TIMER AND KEYBOARD EVENTS 271\\nis, the deﬁnition of the method can assign new values to the in stance variables.) In computer\\nscience, there is the idea of a state machine , which is just something that has a state and\\ncan change state in response to events or inputs. The respons e of a state machine to an event\\nor input depends on what state it’s in. An object is a kind of st ate machine. Sometimes, this\\npoint of view can be very useful in designing classes.\\nThe state machine point of view can be especially useful in th e type of event-oriented\\nprogramming that is required by graphical user interfaces. When designing a GUI program,\\nyou can ask yourself: What information about state do I need t o keep track of ? What events\\ncan change the state of the program? How will my response to a g iven event depend on the\\ncurrent state? Should the appearance of the GUI be changed to reﬂect a change in state? How\\nshould the paintComponent() method take the state into account? All this is an alternativ e to\\nthe top-down, step-wise-reﬁnement style of program design , which does not apply to the overall\\ndesign of an event-oriented program.\\nIn the KeyboardAndFocusDemo program, shown above, the state of the program is recorded\\nin the instance variables squareColor, squareLeft, and squareTop. These state variables are\\nused in the paintComponent() method to decide how to draw the panel. They are changed in\\nthe two key-event-handling methods.\\nIn the rest of this section, we’ll look at another example, wh ere the state plays an even\\nbigger role. In this example, the user plays a simple arcade- style game by pressing the arrow\\nkeys. The main panel of the program is deﬁned in the souce code ﬁle SubKillerPanel.java.\\nAn applet that uses this panel can be found in SubKillerApplet.java, while the stand-alone\\napplication version is SubKiller.java. Y ou can try out the applet in the on-line version of this\\nsection. Here is what it looks like:\\nY ou have to click on the panel to give it the input focus. The pr ogram shows a black\\n“submarine” near the bottom of the panel. When the panel has t he input focus, this submarine\\nmoves back and forth erratically near the bottom. Near the to p, there is a blue “boat”. Y ou\\ncan move this boat back and forth by pressing the left and righ t arrow keys. Attached to the\\nboat is a red “bomb” (or “depth charge”). Y ou can drop the bomb by hitting the down arrow\\nkey . The objective is to blow up the submarine by hitting it wi th the bomb. If the bomb falls\\noﬀ the bottom of the screen, you get a new one. If the submarine explodes, a new sub is created\\nand you get a new bomb. T ry it! Make sure to hit the sub at least o nce, so you can see the\\nexplosion.\\nLet’s think about how this program can be programmed. First o f all, since we are doing\\nobject-oriented programming, I decided to represent the bo at, the depth charge, and the sub-\\nmarine as objects. Each of these objects is deﬁned by a separa te nested class inside the main\\npanel class, and each object has its own state which is repres ented by the instance variables in'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nthe corresponding class. I use variables boat, bomb, and sub in the panel class to refer to the\\nboat, bomb, and submarine objects.\\nNow, what constitutes the “state” of the program? That is, wh at things change from time\\nto time and aﬀect the appearance or behavior of the program? O f course, the state includes\\nthe positions of the boat, submarine, and bomb, so I need vari ables to store the positions.\\nAnything else, possibly less obvious? W ell, sometimes the b omb is falling, and sometimes it’s\\nnot. That is a diﬀerence in state. Since there are two possibi lities, I represent this aspect of the\\nstate with a boolean variable in the bomb object, bomb.isFalling. Sometimes the submarine is\\nmoving left and sometimes it is moving right. The diﬀerence i s represented by another boolean\\nvariable, sub.isMovingLeft. Sometimes, the sub is exploding. This is also part of the sta te,\\nand it is represented by a boolean variable, sub.isExploding. However, the explosions require\\na little more thought. An explosion is something that takes p lace over a series of frames. While\\nan explosion is in progress, the sub looks diﬀerent in each fr ame, as the size of the explosion\\nincreases. Also, I need to know when the explosion is over so t hat I can go back to moving and\\ndrawing the sub as usual. So, I use an integer variable, sub.explosionFrameNumber to record\\nhow many frames have been drawn since the explosion started; the value of this variable is used\\nonly when an explosion is in progress.\\nHow and when do the values of these state variables change? So me of them seem to change\\non their own: F or example, as the sub moves left and right, the state variables the that specify\\nits position are changing. Of course, these variables are ch anging because of an animation, and\\nthat animation is driven by a timer. Each time an event is gene rated by the timer, some of the\\nstate variables have to change to get ready for the next frame of the animation. The changes\\nare made by the action listener that listens for events from t he timer. The boat, bomb, and\\nsub objects each contain an updateForNextFrame() method that updates the state variables\\nof the object to get ready for the next frame of the animation. The action listener for the timer\\ncalls these methods with the statements\\nboat.updateForNewFrame();\\nbomb.updateForNewFrame();\\nsub.updateForNewFrame();\\nThe action listener also calls repaint(), so that the panel will be redrawn to reﬂect its new\\nstate. There are several state variables that change in thes e update methods, in addition to\\nthe position of the sub: If the bomb is falling, then its y-coo rdinate increases from one frame\\nto the next. If the bomb hits the sub, then the isExploding variable of the sub changes to\\ntrue, and the isFalling variable of the bomb becomes false. The isFalling variable also\\nbecomes false when the bomb falls oﬀ the bottom of the screen. If the sub is exploding, then\\nits explosionFrameNumber increases from one frame to the next, and when it reaches a cer tain\\nvalue, the explosion ends and isExploding is reset to false. At random times, the sub switches\\nbetween moving to the left and moving to the right. Its direct ion of motion is recorded in the\\nthe sub’s isMovingLeft variable. The sub’s updateForNewFrame() method includes the lines\\nif ( Math.random() < 0.04 )\\nisMovingLeft = ! isMovingLeft;\\nThere is a 1 in 25 chance that Math.random() will be less than 0.04, so the statement\\n“ isMovingLeft = ! isMovingLeft” is executed in one in every twenty-ﬁve frames, on the\\naverage. The eﬀect of this statement is to reverse the value o f isMovingLeft, from false to true\\nor from true to false. That is, the direction of motion of the s ub is reversed.\\nIn addtion to changes in state that take place from one frame t o the next, a few state\\nvariables change when the user presses certain keys. In the p rogram, this is checked in a'),\n",

If the user presses the down a rrow key , the bomb changes\\nfrom not-falling to falling. This is coded in the keyPressed()method of a KeyListener that is\\nregistered to listen for key events on the panel; that method reads as follows:\\npublic void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt) {\\nint code = evt.getKeyCode(); // which key was pressed.\\nif (code == KeyEvent.VK\\nLEFT) {\\n// Move the boat left. (If this moves the boat out of the frame, its\\n// position will be adjusted in the boat.updateForNewFrame() method.)\\nboat.centerX -= 15;\\n}\\nelse if (code == KeyEvent.VK\\nRIGHT) {\\n// Move the boat right. (If this moves boat out of the frame, it s\\n// position will be adjusted in the boat.updateForNewFrame() method.)\\nboat.centerX += 15;\\n}\\nelse if (code == KeyEvent.VK\\nDOWN) {\\n// Start the bomb falling, it is is not already falling.\\nif ( bomb.isFalling == false )\\nbomb.isFalling = true;\\n}\\n}\\nNote that it’s not necessary to call repaint() when the state changes, since this panel shows\\nan animation that is constantly being redrawn anyway . Any ch anges in the state will become\\nvisible to the user as soon as the next frame is drawn. At some p oint in the program, I have\\nto make sure that the user does not move the boat oﬀ the screen. I could have done this in\\nkeyPressed(), but I choose to check for this in another routine, in the boat object.\\nI encourage you to read the source code in SubKillerPanel.java. Although a few points are\\ntricky , you should with some eﬀort be able to read and underst and the entire program. T ry to\\nunderstand the program in terms of state machines. Note how t he state of each of the three\\nobjects in the program changes in response to events from the timer and from the user.\\nY ou should also note that the program uses four listeners, to respond to action events from\\nthe timer, key events from the user, focus events, and mouse e vents. (The mouse is used only to\\nrequest the input focus when the user clicks the panel.) The t imer runs only when the panel has\\nthe input focus; this is programmed by having the focus liste ner start the timer when the panel\\ngains the input focus and stop the timer when the panel loses t he input focus. All four listeners\\nare created in the constructor of the SubKillerPanel class using anonymous inner classes. (See\\nSubsection 6.4.5.)\\nWhile it’s not at all sophisticated as arcade games go, the Su bKiller game does use some\\ninteresting programming. And it nicely illustrates how to a pply state-machine thinking in\\nevent-oriented programming.\\n6.6 Basic Components\\nIn preceding sections , you’ve seen how to use a graphics context to draw on the scree n\\nand how to handle mouse events and keyboard events. In one sen se, that’s all there is to\\nGUI programming. If you’re willing to program all the drawin g and handle all the mouse and\\nkeyboard events, you have nothing more to learn.

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nmore work than you need to do, or you would be limiting yoursel f to very simple user interfaces.\\nA typical user interface uses standard GUI components such a s buttons, scroll bars, text-input\\nboxes, and menus. These components have already been writte n for you, so you don’t have to\\nduplicate the work involved in developing them. They know ho w to draw themselves, and they\\ncan handle the details of processing the mouse and keyboard e vents that concern them.\\nConsider one of the simplest user interface components, a pu sh button. The button has a\\nborder, and it displays some text. This text can be changed. S ometimes the button is disabled,\\nso that clicking on it doesn’t have any eﬀect. When it is disab led, its appearance changes. When\\nthe user clicks on the push button, the button changes appear ance while the mouse button is\\npressed and changes back when the mouse button is released. I n fact, it’s more complicated\\nthan that. If the user moves the mouse outside the push button before releasing the mouse\\nbutton, the button changes to its regular appearance. T o imp lement this, it is necessary to\\nrespond to mouse exit or mouse drag events. F urthermore, on m any platforms, a button can\\nreceive the input focus. The button changes appearance when it has the focus. If the button\\nhas the focus and the user presses the space bar, the button is triggered. This means that the\\nbutton must respond to keyboard and focus events as well.\\nF ortunately , you don’t have to program any of this, provided you use an object belonging\\nto the standard class javax.swing.JButton. A JButton object draws itself and processes\\nmouse, keyboard, and focus events on its own. Y ou only hear fr om the Button when the\\nuser triggers it by clicking on it or pressing the space bar wh ile the button has the input\\nfocus. When this happens, the JButton object creates an event object belonging to the class\\njava.awt.event.ActionEvent. The event object is sent to any registered listeners to tell them\\nthat the button has been pushed. Y our program gets only the in formation it needs—the fact\\nthat a button was pushed.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe standard components that are deﬁned as part of the Swing g raphical user interface\\nAPI are deﬁned by subclasses of the class JComponent, which is itself a subclass of Component.\\n(Note that this includes the JPanel class that we have already been working with extensively .)\\nMany useful methods are deﬁned in the Component and JComponent classes and so can be used\\nwith any Swing component. W e begin by looking at a few of these methods. Suppose that comp\\nis a variable that refers to some JComponent. Then the following methods can be used:\\n• comp.getWidth() and comp.getHeight() are functions that give the current size of the\\ncomponent, in pixels. One warning: When a component is ﬁrst c reated, its size is zero.\\nThe size will be set later, probably by a layout manager. A com mon mistake is to check\\nthe size of a component before that size has been set, such as i n a constructor.\\n• comp.setEnabled(true) and comp.setEnabled(false) can be used to enable and disable\\nthe component. When a component is disabled, its appearance might change, and the user\\ncannot do anything with it. There is a boolean-valued functi on, comp.isEnabled() that\\nyou can call to discover whether the component is enabled.\\n• comp.setVisible(true) and comp.setVisible(false) can be called to hide or show the\\ncomponent.\\n• comp.setFont(font) sets the font that is used for text displayed on the component . See\\nSubsection 6.3.3 for a discussion of fonts.\\n• comp.setBackground(color) and comp.setForeground(color) set the background and\\nforeground colors for the component. See Subsection 6.3.2.'),\n",

BASIC COMPONENTS 275\\n• comp.setOpaque(true) tells the component that the area occupied by the component\\nshould be ﬁlled with the component’s background color befor e the content of the com-\\nponent is painted. By default, only JLabels are non-opaque. A non-opaque, or “trans-\\nparent”, component ignores its background color and simply paints its content over the\\ncontent of its container. This usually means that it inherit s the background color from its\\ncontainer.\\n• comp.setToolTipText(string) sets the speciﬁed string as a “tool tip” for the component.\\nThe tool tip is displayed if the mouse cursor is in the compone nt and the mouse is not\\nmoved for a few seconds. The tool tip should give some informa tion about the meaning\\nof the component or how to use it.\\n• comp.setPreferredSize(size) sets the size at which the component should be displayed,\\nif possible. The parameter is of type java.awt.Dimension, where an object of type Di-\\nmension has two public integer-valued instance variables, width and height. A call to this\\nmethod usually looks something like “ setPreferredSize( new Dimension(100,50) )”.\\nThe preferred size is used as a hint by layout managers, but wi ll not be respected in all\\ncases. Standard components generally compute a correct pre ferred size automatically , but\\nit can be useful to set it in some cases. F or example, if you use a JPanel as a drawing\\nsurface, it might be a good idea to set a preferred size for it.\\nNote that using any component is a multi-step process. The co mponent object must be\\ncreated with a constructor. It must be added to a container. I n many cases, a listener must\\nbe registered to respond to events from the component. And in some cases, a reference to the\\ncomponent must be saved in an instance variable so that the co mponent can be manipulated by\\nthe program after it has been created. In this section, we wil l look at a few of the basic standard\\ncomponents that are available in Swing. In the next section w e will consider the problem of\\nlaying out components in containers.\\n6.6.1 JButton\\nAn object of class JButton is a push button that the user can click to trigger some action .\\nY ou’ve already seen buttons used in Section 6.1 and Section 6 .2, but we consider them in\\nmuch more detail here. T o use any component eﬀectively , ther e are several aspects of the\\ncorresponding class that you should be familiar with. F or JButton, as an example, I list these\\naspects explicitely:\\n• Constructors: The JButton class has a constructor that takes a string as a parameter.\\nThis string becomes the text displayed on the button. F or exa mple: stopGoButton =\\nnew JButton(\"Go\"). This creates a button object that will display the text, “Go ” (but\\nremember that the button must still be added to a container be fore it can appear on the\\nscreen).\\n• Events: When the user clicks on a button, the button generates an eve nt of type Action-\\nEvent. This event is sent to any listener that has been registered w ith the button as an\\nActionListener.\\n• Listeners: An object that wants to handle events generated by buttons m ust imple-\\nment the ActionListener interface. This interface deﬁnes just one method, “ public void\\nactionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)”, which is called to notify the object of an action\\nevent.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'AFPL Ghostscript 8.51', 'creator': 'dvips(k) 5.95b Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software', 'creationdate': 'D:20071115202101', 'moddate': 'D:20071115202101', 'title': 'javanotes.dvi', 'source': '../data/rag_data/javanotes5.pdf', 'total_pages': 699, 'page': 291, 'page_label': '292', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='276 CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\n• Registration of Listeners : In order to actually receive notiﬁcation of an event from a\\nbutton, an ActionListener must be registered with the button. This is done with the but-\\nton’s addActionListener() method. F or example: stopGoButton.addActionListener(\\nbuttonHandler );\\n• Event methods : When actionPerformed(evt) is called by the button, the parameter,\\nevt, contains information about the event. This information ca n be retrieved by calling\\nmethods in the ActionEvent class. In particular, evt.getActionCommand() returns a\\nString giving the command associated with the button. By default, t his command is the\\ntext that is displayed on the button, but it is possible to set it to some other string. The\\nmethod evt.getSource() returns a reference to the Object that produced the event,\\nthat is, to the JButton that was pressed. The return value is of type Object, not JButton,\\nbecause other types of components can also produce ActionEvents.\\n• Component methods : Several useful methods are deﬁned in the JButton class. F or\\nexample, stopGoButton.setText(\"Stop\") changes the text displayed on the button to\\n“Stop”. And stopGoButton.setActionCommand(\"sgb\") changes the action command\\nassociated to this button for action events.\\nOf course, JButtons also have all the general Component methods, such as setEnabled()\\nand setFont(). The setEnabled() and setText() methods of a button are particularly useful\\nfor giving the user information about what is going on in the p rogram. A disabled button is\\nbetter than a button that gives an obnoxious error message su ch as “Sorry , you can’t click on\\nme now!”\\n6.6.2 JLabel\\nJLabel is certainly the simplest type of component. An object of typ e JLabel exists just to\\ndisplay a line of text. The text cannot be edited by the user, a lthough it can be changed by\\nyour program. The constructor for a JLabel speciﬁes the text to be displayed:\\nJLabel message = new JLabel(\"Hello World!\");\\nThere is another constructor that speciﬁes where in the labe l the text is located, if there is\\nextra space. The possible alignments are given by the consta nts JLabel.LEFT, JLabel.CENTER,\\nand JLabel.RIGHT. F or example,\\nJLabel message = new JLabel(\"Hello World!\", JLabel.CENTER);\\ncreates a label whose text is centered in the available space . Y ou can change the text displayed\\nin a label by calling the label’s setText() method:\\nmessage.setText(\"Goodby World!\");\\nSince the JLabel class is a subclass of JComponent, you can use methods such as\\nsetForeground() with labels. If you want the background color to have any eﬀec t, you should\\ncall setOpaque(true) on the label, since otherwise the JLabel might not ﬁll in its background.\\nF or example:\\nJLabel message = new JLabel(\"Hello World!\", JLabel.CENTER);\\nmessage.setForeground(Color.RED); // Display red text.. .\\nmessage.setBackground(Color.BLACK); // on a black backgr ound...\\nmessage.setFont(new Font(\"Serif\",Font.BOLD,18)); // in a big bold font.\\nmessage.setOpaque(true); // Make sure background is fille d in.'),\n",

BASIC COMPONENTS 277\\n6.6.3 JCheckBox\\nA JCheckBox is a component that has two states: selected or unselected. T he user can change\\nthe state of a check box by clicking on it. The state of a checkb ox is represented by a boolean\\nvalue that is true if the box is selected and false if the box is unselected. A checkbox has a\\nlabel, which is speciﬁed when the box is constructed:\\nJCheckBox showTime = new JCheckBox(\"Show Current Time\");\\nUsually , it’s the user who sets the state of a JCheckBox, but you can also set the state\\nin your program. The current state of a checkbox is set using i ts setSelected(boolean)\\nmethod. F or example, if you want the checkbox showTime to be checked, you would say\\n“ showTime.setSelected(true)\". T o uncheck the box, say “ showTime.setSelected(false)\".\\nY ou can determine the current state of a checkbox by calling i ts isSelected() method, which\\nreturns a boolean value.\\nIn many cases, you don’t need to worry about events from check boxes. Y our program can\\njust check the state whenever it needs to know it by calling th e isSelected() method. However,\\na checkbox does generate an event when its state is changed by the user, and you can detect this\\nevent and respond to it if you want something to happen at the m oment the state changes. When\\nthe state of a checkbox is changed by the user, it generates an event of type ActionEvent. If you\\nwant something to happen when the user changes the state, you must register an ActionListener\\nwith the checkbox by calling its addActionListener() method. (Note that if you change\\nthe state by calling the setSelected() method, no ActionEvent is generated. However, there\\nis another method in the JCheckBox class, doClick(), which simulates a user click on the\\ncheckbox and does generate an ActionEvent.)\\nWhen handling an ActionEvent, you can call evt.getSource() in the actionPerformed()\\nmethod to ﬁnd out which object generated the event. (Of cours e, if you are only listening for\\nevents from one component, you don’t even have to do this.) Th e returned value is of type\\nObject, but you can type-cast it to another type if you want. Once you know the object\\nthat generated the event, you can ask the object to tell you it s current state. F or example,\\nif you know that the event had to come from one of two checkboxe s, cb1 or cb2, then your\\nactionPerformed() method might look like this:\\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {\\nObject source = evt.getSource();\\nif (source == cb1) {\\nboolean newState = cb1.isSelected();\\n... // respond to the change of state\\n}\\nelse if (source == cb2) {\\nboolean newState = cb2.isSelected();\\n... // respond to the change of state\\n}\\n}\\nAlternatively , you can use evt.getActionCommand() to retrieve the action command asso-\\nciated with the source.

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\n6.6.4 JT extField and JT extArea\\nThe JT extField and JT extArea classes represent components that contain text that can be e dited\\nby the user. A JT extField holds a single line of text, while a JT extArea can hold multiple lines.\\nIt is also possible to set a JT extField or JT extArea to be read-only so that the user can read the\\ntext that it contains but cannot edit the text. Both classes a re subclasses of an abstract class,\\nJT extComponent, which deﬁnes their common properties.\\nJT extField and JT extArea have many methods in common. The instance method setText(),\\nwhich takes a parameter of type String, can be used to change the text that is displayed in an\\ninput component. The contents of the component can be retrie ved by calling its getText()\\ninstance method, which returns a value of type String. If you want to stop the user from\\nmodifying the text, you can call setEditable(false). Call the same method with a parameter\\nof true to make the input component user-editable again.\\nThe user can only type into a text component when it has the inp ut focus. The user can\\ngive the input focus to a text component by clicking it with th e mouse, but sometimes it is\\nuseful to give the input focus to a text ﬁeld programmaticall y . Y ou can do this by calling its\\nrequestFocus() method. F or example, when I discover an error in the user’s in put, I usually\\ncall requestFocus() on the text ﬁeld that contains the error. This helps the user s ee where\\nthe error occurred and lets the user start typing the correct ion immediately .\\nBy default, there is no space between the text in a text compon ent and the edge of the\\ncomponent, which usually doesn’t look very good. Y ou can use the setMargin() method of\\nthe component to add some blank space between the edge of the c omponent and the text.\\nThis method takes a parameter of type java.awt.Insets which contains four integer instance\\nvariables that specify the margins on the top, left, bottom, and right edge of the component.\\nF or example,\\ntextComponent.setMargin( new Insets(5,5,5,5) );\\nadds a ﬁve-pixel margin between the text in textComponent and each edge of the component.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe JT extField class has a constructor\\npublic JTextField(int columns)\\nwhere columns is an integer that speciﬁes the number of characters that sho uld be visible in the\\ntext ﬁeld. This is used to determine the preferred width of th e text ﬁeld. (Because characters\\ncan be of diﬀerent sizes and because the preferred width is no t always respected, the actual\\nnumber of characters visible in the text ﬁeld might not be equ al to columns.) Y ou don’t have\\nto specify the number of columns; for example, you might use t he text ﬁeld in a context where\\nit will expand to ﬁll whatever space is available. In that cas e, you can use the constructor\\nJTextField(), with no parameters. Y ou can also use the following construc tors, which specify\\nthe initial contents of the text ﬁeld:\\npublic JTextField(String contents);\\npublic JTextField(String contents, int columns);\\nThe constructors for a JT extArea are\\npublic JTextArea()\\npublic JTextArea(int rows, int columns)\\npublic JTextArea(String contents)\\npublic JTextArea(String contents, int rows, int columns)'),\n",

BASIC COMPONENTS 279\\nThe parameter rows speciﬁes how many lines of text should be visible in the text a rea. This\\ndetermines the preferred height of the text area, just as columns determines the preferred width.\\nHowever, the text area can actually contain any number of lin es; the text area can be scrolled\\nto reveal lines that are not currently visible. It is common t o use a JT extArea as the CENTER\\ncomponent of a BorderLayout. In that case, it is less useful t o specify the number of lines and\\ncolumns, since the T extArea will expand to ﬁll all the space a vailable in the center area of the\\ncontainer.\\nThe JT extArea class adds a few useful methods to those inherited from JTextComponent.\\nF or example, the instance method append(moreText), where moreText is of type String, adds\\nthe speciﬁed text at the end of the current content of the text area. (When using append()\\nor setText() to add text to a JT extArea, line breaks can be inserted in the text by using the\\nnewline character, ’\\\\n’.) And setLineWrap(wrap), where wrap is of type boolean, tells what\\nshould happen when a line of text is too long to be displayed in the text area. If wrap is true,\\nthen any line that is too long will be “wrapped” onto the next l ine; if wrap is false, the line will\\nsimply extend outside the text area, and the user will have to scroll the text area horizontally\\nto see the entire line. The default value of wrap is false.\\nSince it might be necessary to scroll a text area to see all the text that it contains, you might\\nexpect a text area to come with scroll bars. Unfortunately , t his does not happen automatically .\\nT o get scroll bars for a text area, you have to put the JT extArea inside another component,\\ncalled a JScrollPane. This can be done as follows:\\nJTextArea inputArea = new JTextArea();\\nJScrollPane scroller = new JScrollPane( inputArea );\\nThe scroll pane provides scroll bars that can be used to scrol l the text in the text area. The\\nscroll bars will appear only when needed, that is when the siz e of the text exceeds the size of\\nthe text area. Note that when you want to put the text area into a container, you should add\\nthe scroll pane, not the text area itself, to the container.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nWhen the user is typing in a JT extField and presses return, an ActionEvent is generated.\\nIf you want to respond to such events, you can register an ActionListener with the text ﬁeld,\\nusing the text ﬁeld’s addActionListener() method. (Since a JT extArea can contain multiple\\nlines of text, pressing return in a text area does not generat e an event; is simply begins a new\\nline of text.)\\nJT extField has a subclass, JPasswordField, which is identical except that it does not reveal\\nthe text that it contains. The characters in a JPasswordField are all displayed as asterisks (or\\nsome other ﬁxed character). A password ﬁeld is, obviously , d esigned to let the user enter a\\npassword without showing that password on the screen.\\nT ext components are actually quite complex, and I have cover ed only their most basic\\nproperties here. I will return to the topic of text component s in Subsection 12.4.4.\\n6.6.5 JComboBox\\nThe JComboBox class provides a way to let the user select one option from a li st of options.\\nThe options are presented as a kind of pop-up menu, and only th e currently selected option is\\nvisible on the screen.\\nWhen a JComboBox object is ﬁrst constructed, it initially contains no items. An item is\\nadded to the bottom of the menu by calling the combo box’s inst ance method, addItem(str),\\nwhere str is the string that will be displayed in the menu.'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nF or example, the following code will create an object of type JComboBox that contains the\\noptions Red, Blue, Green, and Black:\\nJComboBox colorChoice = new JComboBox();\\ncolorChoice.addItem(\"Red\");\\ncolorChoice.addItem(\"Blue\");\\ncolorChoice.addItem(\"Green\");\\ncolorChoice.addItem(\"Black\");\\nY ou can call the getSelectedIndex() method of a JComboBox to ﬁnd out which item\\nis currently selected. This method returns an integer that g ives the position of the selected\\nitem in the list, where the items are numbered starting from z ero. Alternatively , you can call\\ngetSelectedItem() to get the selected item itself. (This method returns a value of type Object,\\nsince a JComboBox can actually hold other types of objects besides strings.) Y ou can change\\nthe selection by calling the method setSelectedIndex(n), where n is an integer giving the\\nposition of the item that you want to select.\\nThe most common way to use a JComboBox is to call its getSelectedIndex() method when\\nyou have a need to know which item is currently selected. Howe ver, like other components that\\nwe have seen, JComboBox components generate ActionEvents when the user selects an item.\\nY ou can register an ActionListener with the JComboBox if you want to respond to such events\\nas they occur.\\nJComboBoxes have a nifty feature, which is probably not all that useful in practice. Y ou can\\nmake a JComboBox “editable” by calling its method setEditable(true). If you do this, the\\nuser can edit the selection by clicking on the JComboBox and typing. This allows the user to\\nmake a selection that is not in the pre-conﬁgured list that yo u provide. (The “Combo” in the\\nname “JComboBox” refers to the fact that it’s a kind of combin ation of menu and text-input\\nbox.) If the user has edited the selection in this way , then th e getSelectedIndex() method\\nwill return the value -1, and getSelectedItem() will return the string that the user typed.\\nAn ActionEvent is triggered if the user presses return while typing in the JComboBox.\\n6.6.6 JSlider\\nA JSlider provides a way for the user to select an integer value from a ra nge of possible values.\\nThe user does this by dragging a “knob” along a bar. A slider ca n, optionally , be decorated\\nwith tick marks and with labels. This picture shows three sli ders with diﬀerent decorations and\\nwith diﬀerent ranges of values:\\nHere, the second slider is decorated with ticks, and the thir d one is decorated with labels. It’s\\npossible for a single slider to have both types of decoration s.\\nThe most commonly used constructor for JSliders speciﬁes the start and end of the range\\nof values for the slider and its initial value when it ﬁrst app ears on the screen:\\npublic JSlider(int minimum, int maximum, int value)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'AFPL Ghostscript 8.51', 'creator': 'dvips(k) 5.95b Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software', 'creationdate': 'D:20071115202101', 'moddate': 'D:20071115202101', 'title': 'javanotes.dvi', 'source': '../data/rag_data/javanotes5.pdf', 'total_pages': 699, 'page': 296, 'page_label': '297', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='6.6. BASIC COMPONENTS 281\\nIf the parameters are omitted, the values 0, 100, and 50 are us ed. By default, a slider is horizon-\\ntal, but you can make it vertical by calling its method setOrientation(JSlider.VERTICAL).\\nThe current value of a JSlider can be read at any time with its getValue() method, which\\nreturns a value of type int. If you want to change the value, you can do so with the method\\nsetValue(n), which takes a parameter of type int.\\nIf you want to respond immediately when the user changes the v alue of a slider, you can\\nregister a listener with the slider. JSliders, unlike other components we have seen, do not\\ngenerate ActionEvents. Instead, they generate events of type ChangeEvent. ChangeEvent and\\nrelated classes are deﬁned in the package javax.swing.event rather than java.awt.event, so\\nif you want to use ChangeEvents, you should import javax.swing.event.* at the beginning\\nof your program. Y ou must also deﬁne some object to implement the ChangeListener interface,\\nand you must register the change listener with the slider by c alling its addChangeListener()\\nmethod. A ChangeListener must provide a deﬁnition for the method:\\npublic void stateChanged(ChangeEvent evt)\\nThis method will be called whenever the value of the slider ch anges. (Note that it will also\\nbe called when you change the value with the setValue() method, as well as when the user\\nchanges the value.) In the stateChanged() method, you can call evt.getSource() to ﬁnd out\\nwhich object generated the event.\\nUsing tick marks on a slider is a two-step process: Specify th e interval between the tick\\nmarks, and tell the slider that the tick marks should be displ ayed. There are actually two\\ntypes of tick marks, “major” tick marks and “minor” tick mark s. Y ou can have one or\\nthe other or both. Major tick marks are a bit longer than minor tick marks. The method\\nsetMinorTickSpacing(i) indicates that there should be a minor tick mark every i units along\\nthe slider. The parameter is an integer. (The spacing is in te rms of values on the slider, not\\npixels.) F or the major tick marks, there is a similar command , setMajorTickSpacing(i).\\nCalling these methods is not enough to make the tick marks app ear. Y ou also have to call\\nsetPaintTicks(true). F or example, the second slider in the above picture was crea ted and\\nconﬁgured using the commands:\\nslider2 = new JSlider(); // (Uses default min, max, and value .)\\nslider2.addChangeListener(this);\\nslider2.setMajorTickSpacing(25);\\nslider2.setMinorTickSpacing(5);\\nslider2.setPaintTicks(true);\\nLabels on a slider are handled similarly . Y ou have to specify the labels and tell the slider to\\npaint them. Specifying labels is a tricky business, but the JSlider class has a method to simplify\\nit. Y ou can create a set of labels and add them to a slider named sldr with the command:\\nsldr.setLabelTable( sldr.createStandardLabels(i) );\\nwhere i is an integer giving the spacing between the labels. T o arran ge for the labels to be\\ndisplayed, call setPaintLabels(true). F or example, the third slider in the above picture was\\ncreated and conﬁgured with the commands:\\nslider3 = new JSlider(2000,2100,2006);\\nslider3.addChangeListener(this);\\nslider3.setLabelTable( slider3.createStandardLabels(50) );\\nslider3.setPaintLabels(true);'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\n6.7 Basic Layout\\nComponents are the fundamental building blocks of a graphical user inte rface. But you have\\nto do more with components besides create them. Another aspe ct of GUI programming is\\nlaying out components on the screen, that is, deciding where they are dr awn and how big\\nthey are. Y ou have probably noticed that computing coordina tes can be a diﬃcult problem,\\nespecially if you don’t assume a ﬁxed size for the drawing are a. Java has a solution for this, as\\nwell.\\nComponents are the visible objects that make up a GUI. Some co mponents are containers,\\nwhich can hold other components. Containers in Java are obje cts that belong to some subclass of\\njava.awt.Container. The content pane of a JApplet or JFrame is an example of a container.\\nThe standard class JPanel, which we have mostly used as a drawing surface up till now, is\\nanother example of a container.\\nBecause a JPanel object is a container, it can hold other components. Because a JPanel is\\nitself a component, you can add a JPanel to another JPanel. This makes complex nesting of\\ncomponents possible. JPanels can be used to organize complicated user interfaces, as show n in\\nthis illustration:\\nThe components in a container must be “laid out,” which means setting their sizes and\\npositions. It’s possible to program the layout yourself, bu t ordinarily layout is done by a\\nlayout manager . A layout manager is an object associated with a container th at implements\\nsome policy for laying out the components in that container. Diﬀerent types of layout manager\\nimplement diﬀerent policies. In this section, we will cover the three most common types of\\nlayout manager, and then we will look at several programming examples that use components\\nand layout.\\nEvery container has an instance method, setLayout(), that takes a parameter of type\\nLayoutManager and that is used to specify the layout manager that will be res ponsible for laying\\nout any components that are added to the container. Componen ts are added to a container by\\ncalling an instance method named add() in the container object. There are actually several\\nversions of the add() method, with diﬀerent parameter lists. Diﬀerent versions o f add() are\\nappropriate for diﬀerent layout managers, as we will see bel ow.'),\n",

BASIC LA YOUT 283\\n6.7.1 Basic Layout Managers\\nJava has a variety of standard layout managers that can be use d as parameters in the\\nsetLayout() method. They are deﬁned by classes in the package java.awt. Here, we will\\nlook at just three of these layout manager classes: FlowLayout, BorderLayout, and GridLayout.\\nA FlowLayout simply lines up components in a row across the container. The size of each\\ncomponent is equal to that component’s “preferred size.” Af ter laying out as many items as will\\nﬁt in a row across the container, the layout manager will move on to the next row. The default\\nlayout for a JPanel is a FlowLayout; that is, a JPanel uses a FlowLayout unless you specify a\\ndiﬀerent layout manager by calling the panel’s setLayout() method.\\nThe components in a given row can be either left-aligned, rig ht-aligned, or centered within\\nthat row, and there can be horizontal and vertical gaps betwe en components. If the default\\nconstructor, “ new FlowLayout()”, is used, then the components on each row will be centered\\nand both the horizontal and the vertical gaps will be ﬁve pixe ls. The constructor\\npublic FlowLayout(int align, int hgap, int vgap)\\ncan be used to specify alternative alignment and gaps. The po ssible values of align are\\nFlowLayout.LEFT, FlowLayout.RIGHT, and FlowLayout.CENTER.\\nSuppose that cntr is a container object that is using a FlowLayout as its layout manager.\\nThen, a component, comp, can be added to the container with the statement\\ncntr.add(comp);\\nThe FlowLayout will line up all the components that have been added to the con tainer in this\\nway . They will be lined up in the order in which they were added . F or example, this picture\\nshows ﬁve buttons in a panel that uses a FlowLayout:\\nNote that since the ﬁve buttons will not ﬁt in a single row acro ss the panel, they are arranged\\nin two rows. In each row, the buttons are grouped together and are centered in the row. The\\nbuttons were added to the panel using the statements:\\npanel.add(button1);\\npanel.add(button2);\\npanel.add(button3);\\npanel.add(button4);\\npanel.add(button5);\\nWhen a container uses a layout manager, the layout manager is ordinarily responsible for\\ncomputing the preferred size of the container (although a di ﬀerent preferred size could be\\nset by calling the container’s setPreferredSize method). A FlowLayout prefers to put its\\ncomponents in a single row, so the preferred width is the tota l of the preferred widths of all\\nthe components, plus the horizontal gaps between the compon ents. The preferred height is the\\nmaximum preferred height of all the components.\\n∗ ∗ ∗'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nA BorderLayout layout manager is designed to display one large, central com ponent, with up\\nto four smaller components arranged along the edges of the ce ntral component. If a container,\\ncntr, is using a BorderLayout, then a component, comp, should be added to the container using\\na statement of the form\\ncntr.add( comp, borderLayoutPosition );\\nwhere borderLayoutPosition speciﬁes what position the component should occupy in the\\nlayout and is given as one of the constants BorderLayout.CENTER, BorderLayout.NORTH,\\nBorderLayout.SOUTH, BorderLayout.EAST, or BorderLayout.WEST. The meaning of the ﬁve\\npositions is shown in this diagram:\\nNote that a border layout can contain fewer than ﬁve compompo ntnts, so that not all ﬁve of\\nthe possible positions need to be ﬁlled.\\nA BorderLayout selects the sizes of its components as follows: The NORTH and SOUTH com-\\nponents (if present) are shown at their preferred heights, b ut their width is set equal to the full\\nwidth of the container. The EAST and WEST components are shown at their preferred widths,\\nbut their height is set to the height of the container, minus t he space occupied by the NORTH\\nand SOUTH components. Finally , the CENTER component takes up any remaining space; the\\npreferred size of the CENTER component is completely ignored. Y ou should make sure that\\nthe components that you put into a BorderLayout are suitable for the positions that they will\\noccupy . A horizontal slider or text ﬁeld, for example, would work well in the NORTH or SOUTH\\nposition, but wouldn’t make much sense in the EAST or WEST position.\\nThe default constructor, new BorderLayout(), leaves no space between components. If you\\nwould like to leave some space, you can specify horizontal an d vertical gaps in the constructor\\nof the BorderLayout object. F or example, if you say\\npanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout(5,7));\\nthen the layout manager will insert horizontal gaps of 5 pixe ls between components and vertical\\ngaps of 7 pixels between components. The background color of the container will show through\\nin these gaps. The default layout for the original content pa ne that comes with a JFrame or\\nJApplet is a BorderLayout with no horizontal or vertical gap.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nFinally , we consider the GridLayout layout manager. A grid layout lays out components in a\\ngrid of equal sized rectangles. This illustration shows how the components would be arranged\\nin a grid layout with 3 rows and 2 columns:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'AFPL Ghostscript 8.51', 'creator': 'dvips(k) 5.95b Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software', 'creationdate': 'D:20071115202101', 'moddate': 'D:20071115202101', 'title': 'javanotes.dvi', 'source': '../data/rag_data/javanotes5.pdf', 'total_pages': 699, 'page': 300, 'page_label': '301', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='6.7. BASIC LA YOUT 285\\nIf a container uses a GridLayout, the appropriate add method for the container takes a single\\nparameter of type Component (for example: cntr.add(comp)). Components are added to the\\ngrid in the order shown; that is, each row is ﬁlled from left to right before going on the next\\nrow.\\nThe constructor for a GridLayout takes the form “ new GridLayout(R,C)”, where R is the\\nnumber of rows and C is the number of columns. If you want to leave horizontal gaps of H pixels\\nbetween columns and vertical gaps of V pixels between rows, use “ new GridLayout(R,C,H,V)”\\ninstead.\\nWhen you use a GridLayout, it’s probably good form to add just enough components to ﬁll\\nthe grid. However, this is not required. In fact, as long as yo u specify a non-zero value for the\\nnumber of rows, then the number of columns is essentially ign ored. The system will use just as\\nmany columns as are necessary to hold all the components that you add to the container. If you\\nwant to depend on this behavior, you should probably specify zero as the number of columns.\\nY ou can also specify the number of rows as zero. In that case, y ou must give a non-zero number\\nof columns. The system will use the speciﬁed number of column s, with just as many rows as\\nnecessary to hold the components that are added to the contai ner.\\nHorizontal grids, with a single row, and vertical grids, wit h a single column, are very com-\\nmon. F or example, suppose that button1, button2, and button3 are buttons and that you’d\\nlike to display them in a horizontal row in a panel. If you use a horizontal grid for the panel,\\nthen the buttons will completely ﬁll that panel and will all b e the same size. The panel can be\\ncreated as follows:\\nJPanel buttonBar = new JPanel();\\nbuttonBar.setLayout( new GridLayout(1,3) );\\n// (Note: The \"3\" here is pretty much ignored, and\\n// you could also say \"new GridLayout(1,0)\".\\n// To leave gaps between the buttons, you could use\\n// \"new GridLayout(1,0,5,5)\".)\\nbuttonBar.add(button1);\\nbuttonBar.add(button2);\\nbuttonBar.add(button3);\\nY ou might ﬁnd this button bar to be more attractive than the on e that uses the default FlowLay-\\nout layout manager.\\n6.7.2 Borders\\nW e have seen how to leave gaps between the components in a cont ainer, but what if you would\\nlike to leave a border around the outside of the container? Th is problem is not handled by\\nlayout managers. Instead, borders in Swing are represented by objects. A Border object can be\\nadded to any JComponent, not just to containers. Borders can be more than just empty s pace.\\nThe class javax.swing.BorderFactory contains a large number of static methods for creating\\nborder objects. F or example, the function'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nBorderFactory.createLineBorder(Color.BLACK)\\nreturns an object that represents a one-pixel wide black lin e around the outside of a component.\\nIf comp is a JComponent, a border can be added to comp using its setBorder() method. F or\\nexample:\\ncomp.setBorder( BorderFactory.createLineBorder(Color.BLACK) );\\nWhen a border has been set for a JComponent, the border is drawn automatically , without\\nany further eﬀort on the part of the programmer. The border is drawn along the edges of the\\ncomponent, just inside its boundary . The layout manager of a JPanel or other container will\\ntake the space occupied by the border into account. The compo nents that are added to the\\ncontainer will be displayed in the area inside the border. I d on’t recommend using a border on\\na JPanel that is being used as a drawing surface. However, if you do thi s, you should take the\\nborder into account. If you draw in the area occupied by the bo rder, that part of your drawing\\nwill be covered by the border.\\nHere are some of the static methods that can be used to create b orders:\\n• BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(top,left,bottom,right) — leaves an empty bor-\\nder around the edges of a component. Nothing is drawn in this s pace, so the background\\ncolor of the component will appear in the area occupied by the border. The parameters\\nare integers that give the width of the border along the top, l eft, bottom, and right edges\\nof the component. This is actually very useful when used on a JPanel that contains other\\ncomponents. It puts some space between the components and th e edge of the panel. It\\ncan also be useful on a JLabel, which otherwise would not have any space between the\\ntext and the edge of the label.\\n• BorderFactory.createLineBorder(color,thickness) — draws a line around all four\\nedges of a component. The ﬁrst parameter is of type Color and speciﬁes the color of the\\nline. The second parameter is an integer that speciﬁes the th ickness of the border.

In this\\ncase, the subpanel uses a GridLayout with one row and four columns, so that the buttons are\\nall the same size and completely ﬁll the subpanel.\\nOne other point of interest in this example is the actionPerformed() method that responds\\nwhen the user clicks one of the buttons.

F or out next\\nexample, we’ll look at a panel that does not use a layout manag er. If you set the layout manager\\nof a container to be null, by calling container.setLayout(null), then you assume complete\\nresponsibility for positioning and sizing the components i n that container.\\nIf comp is any component, then the statement\\ncomp.setBounds(x, y, width, height);\\nputs the top left corner of the component at the point (x,y), measured in the coordinate system\\nof the container that contains the component, and it sets the width and height of the component\\nto the speciﬁed values. Y ou should only set the bounds of a com ponent if the container that\\ncontains it has a null layout manager. In a container that has a non-null layout manager, the\\nlayout manager is responsible for setting the bounds, and yo u should not interfere with its job.\\nAssuming that you have set the layout manager to null, you can call the setBounds()\\nmethod any time you like. (Y ou can even make a component that m oves or changes size while\\nthe user is watching.) If you are writing a panel that has a kno wn, ﬁxed size, then you can\\nset the bounds of each component in the panel’s constructor. Note that you must also add the\\ncomponents to the panel, using the panel’s add(component) instance method; otherwise, the\\ncomponent will not appear on the screen.\\nOur example contains four components: two buttons, a label, and a panel that displays a\\ncheckerboard pattern:\\nThis is just an example of using a null layout; it doesn’t do an ything, except that clicking the\\nbuttons changes the text of the label. (W e will use this examp le in Section 7.5 as a starting\\npoint for a checkers game.)\\nF or its content pane, this example uses a main panel that is de ﬁned by a class named\\nNullLayoutPanel.

The example\\nis a simple card game in which you look at a playing card and try to predict whether the next\\ncard will be higher or lower in value. (Aces have the lowest va lue in this game.) Y ou’ve seen a\\ntext-oriented version of the same game in Subsection 5.4.3. Section 5.4 also introduced Deck,\\nHand, and Card classes that are used in the game program. In this GUI version of the game,\\nyou click on a button to make your prediction. If you predict w rong, you lose. If you make\\nthree correct predictions, you win. After completing one ga me, you can click the “New Game”\\nbutton to start a new game. Here is what the game looks like:\\nThe complete source code for this example is in the ﬁle HighLowGUI.java. Y ou can try out\\nthe game in the on-line version of this section, or by running the program as a stand-alone\\napplication.\\nThe overall structure of the main panel in this example shoul d be clear: It has three buttons\\nin a subpanel at the bottom of the main panel and a large drawin g surface that displays the\\ncards and a message. The main panel uses a BorderLayout. The drawing surface occupies the\\nCENTER position of the border layout. The subpanel that contains th e buttons occupies the\\nSOUTH position of the border layout, and the other three positions of the layout are empty .\\nThe drawing surface is deﬁned by a nested class named CardPanel, which is a subclass of\\nJPanel. I have chosen to let the drawing surface object do most of the work of the game:\\nIt listens for events from the three buttons and responds by t aking the appropriate actions.\\nThe main panel is deﬁned by HighLowGUI itself, which is another subclass of JPanel. The\\nconstructor of the HighLowGUI class creates all the other components, sets up event handli ng,\\nand lays out the components:\\npublic HighLowGUI() { // The constructor.\\nsetBackground( new Color(130,50,40) );\\nsetLayout( new BorderLayout(3,3) ); // BorderLayout with 3 -pixel gaps.\\nCardPanel board = new CardPanel(); // Where the cards are dra wn.\\nadd(board, BorderLayout.CENTER);\\nJPanel buttonPanel = new JPanel(); // The subpanel that hold s the buttons.\\nbuttonPanel.setBackground( new Color(220,200,180) );\\nadd(buttonPanel, BorderLayout.SOUTH);\\nJButton higher = new JButton( \"Higher\" );'),\n",

(See Subsection 6.5.4.) It is imp ortant to think in terms of the\\nstates that the game can be in, how the state can change, and ho w the response to events\\ncan depend on the state. The approach that produced the origi nal, text-oriented game in\\nSubsection 5.4.3 is not appropriate here. T rying to think ab out the game in terms of a process\\nthat goes step-by-step from beginning to end is more likely t o confuse you than to help you.\\nThe state of the game includes the cards and the message. The c ards are stored in an\\nobject of type Hand. The message is a String. These values are stored in instance variables.\\nThere is also another, less obvious aspect of the state: Some times a game is in progress, and\\nthe user is supposed to make a prediction about the next card. Sometimes we are between\\ngames, and the user is supposed to click the “New Game” button . It’s a good idea to keep\\ntrack of this basic diﬀerence in state. The CardPanel class uses a boolean instance variable\\nnamed gameInProgress for this purpose.\\nThe state of the game can change whenever the user clicks on a b utton. The CardPanel\\nclass implements the ActionListener interface and deﬁnes an actionPerformed() method to\\nrespond to the user’s clicks. This method simply calls one of three other methods, doHigher(),\\ndoLower(), or newGame(), depending on which button was pressed. It’s in these three e vent-\\nhandling methods that the action of the game takes place.\\nW e don’t want to let the user start a new game if a game is curren tly in progress. That would\\nbe cheating. So, the response in the newGame() method is diﬀerent depending on whether the\\nstate variable gameInProgress is true or false. If a game is in progress, the message instance\\nvariable should be set to show an error message. If a game is no t in progress, then all the state\\nvariables should be set to appropriate values for the beginn ing of a new game. In any case, the\\nboard must be repainted so that the user can see that the state has changed. The complete\\nnewGame() method is as follows:\\n/**\\n* Called by the CardPanel constructor, and called by actionPerformed() if\\n* the user clicks the \"New Game\" button. Start a new game.\\n*/\\nvoid doNewGame() {\\nif (gameInProgress) {\\n// If the current game is not over, it is an error to try\\n// to start a new game.\\nmessage = \"You still have to finish this game!\";\\nrepaint();\\nreturn;\\n}'),\n",

Let’s\\nlook at the doHigher() routine. This is called when the user clicks the “Higher” but ton. This\\nonly makes sense if a game is in progress, so the ﬁrst thing doHigher() should do is check the\\nvalue of the state variable gameInProgress. If the value is false, then doHigher() should just\\nset up an error message. If a game is in progress, a new card sho uld be added to the hand and\\nthe user’s prediction should be tested.

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nThe paintComponent() method of the CardPanel class uses the values in the state variables\\nto decide what to show. It displays the string stored in the message variable. It draws each\\nof the cards in the hand. There is one little tricky bit: If a game is in progress, it dr aws an\\nextra face-down card, which is not in the hand, to represent t he next card in the deck. Drawing\\nthe cards requires some care and computation. I wrote a metho d, “ void drawCard(Graphics\\ng, Card card, int x, int y)”, which draws a card with its upper left corner at the point\\n(x,y). The paintComponent() routine decides where to draw each card and calls this routin e\\nto do the drawing. Y ou can check out all the details in the sour ce code, HighLowGUI.java.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nOne further note on the programming of this example: The sour ce code deﬁnes HighLowGUI\\nas a subclass of JPanel. The class contains a main() routine so that it can be run as a stand-alone\\napplication; the main() routine simply opens a window that uses a panel of type HighLowGUI\\nas its content pane. In addition, I decided to write an applet version of the program as a\\nstatic nested class named Applet inside the HighLowGUI class. Since this is a nested class, its\\nfull name is HighLowGUI.Applet and the class ﬁle that is produced when the source code is\\ncompiled is named HighLowGUI$Applet.class. This class is used for the applet version of the\\nprogram in the on-line version of the book. The <applet> tag lists the class ﬁle for the applet\\nas code=\"HighLowGUI$Applet.class\". This is admittedly an unusual way to organize the\\nprogram, and it is probably more natural to have the panel, ap plet, and stand-alone program\\ndeﬁned in separate classes. However, writing the program in this way does show the ﬂexibility\\nof Java classes. (Nested classes were discussed in Subsecti on 5.7.2.)\\n6.8 Menus and Dialogs\\nWe have already encountered many of the basic aspects of GUI programming, but\\nprofessional programs use many additional features.

MENUS AND DIALOGS 297\\nAs the user clicks-and-drags the mouse in the large drawing a rea of this program, it leaves a\\ntrail of little colored squares. There is some random variat ion in the color of the squares. (This\\nis meant to make the picture look a little more like a real mosa ic, which is a picture made out of\\nsmall colored stones in which there would be some natural col or variation.) There is a menu bar\\nabove the drawing area. The “Control” menu contains command s for ﬁlling and clearing the\\ndrawing area, along with a few options that aﬀect the appeara nce of the picture. The “Color”\\nmenu lets the user select the color that will be used when the u ser draws. The “T ools” menu\\naﬀects the behavior of the mouse. Using the default “Draw” to ol, the mouse leaves a trail of\\nsingle squares. Using the “Draw 3x3” tool, the mouse leaves a swath of colored squares that is\\nthree squares wide. There are also “Erase” tools, which let t he user set squares back to their\\ndefault black color.\\nThe drawing area of the program is a panel that belongs to the MosaicPanel class, a subclass\\nof JPanel that is deﬁned in MosaicPanel.java. MosaicPanel is a highly reusable class for repre-\\nsenting mosaics of colored rectangles. It does not directly support drawing on the mosaic, but\\nit does support setting the color of each individual square. The MosaicDraw program installs a\\nmouse listener on the panel; the mouse listener responds to m ousePressed and mouseDragged\\nevents on the panel by setting the color of the square that con tains the mouse. This is a nice\\nexample of applying a listener to an object to do something th at was not programmed into the\\nobject itself.\\nMost of the programming for MosaicDraw can be found in MosaicDrawController.java. (It\\ncould have gone into the MosaicPanel class, if I had not decided to use that pre-existing class\\nin unmodiﬁed form.) It is the MosaicDrawController class that creates a MosaicPanel object\\nand adds a mouse listener to it. It also creates the menu bar th at is shown at the top of\\nthe program and implements all the commands in the menu bar. I t has an instance method\\ngetMosaicPanel() that returns a reference to the mosaic panel that it has creat ed, and it\\nhas another instance method getMenuBar() that returns a menu bar for the program. These\\nmethods are used to obtain the panel and menu bar so that they c an be added to an applet or\\na frame.\\nT o get a working program, an object of type JApplet or JFrame is needed. The ﬁles Mo-\\nsaicDrawApplet.java and MosaicDrawFrame.java deﬁne the applet and frame versions of the\\nprogram. These are rather simple classes; they simply creat e a MosaicDrawController object\\nand use its mosaic panel and menu bar. I urge you to study these ﬁles, along with MosaicDraw-\\nController.java. I will not be discussing all aspects of the code here, but you should be able to\\nunderstand it all after reading this section. As for MosaicPanel.java, it uses some techniques\\nthat you would not understand at this point, but I encourage y ou to at least read the comments\\nin this ﬁle to learn about the API for mosaic panels.\\n6.8.1 Menus and Menubars\\nMosaicDraw is the ﬁrst example that we have seen that uses a me nu bar. F ortunately , menus\\nare very easy to use in Java. The items in a menu are represente d by the class JMenuItem (this\\nclass and other menu-related classes are in package javax.swing). Menu items are used in\\nalmost exactly the same way as buttons. In fact, JMenuItem and JButton are both subclasses\\nof a class, AbstractButton, that deﬁnes their common behavior. In particular, a JMenuItem is\\ncreated using a constructor that speciﬁes the text of the men u item, such as:\\nJMenuItem fillCommand = new JMenuItem(\"Fill\");\\nY ou can add an ActionListener to a JMenuItem by calling the menu item’s addActionListener()'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nmethod. The actionPerformed() method of the action listener is called when the user selects\\nthe item from the menu. Y ou can change the text of the item by ca lling its setText(String)\\nmethod, and you can enable it and disable it using the setEnabled(boolean) method. All this\\nworks in exactly the same way as for a JButton.\\nThe main diﬀerence between a menu item and a button, of course , is that a menu item\\nis meant to appear in a menu rather than in a panel. A menu in Jav a is represented by\\nthe class JMenu. A JMenu has a name, which is speciﬁed in the constructor, and it has an\\nadd(JMenuItem) method that can be used to add a JMenuItem to the menu. So, the “T ools”\\nmenu in the MosaicDraw program could be created as follows, w here listener is a variable of\\ntype ActionListener:\\nJMenu toolsMenu = new JMenu(\"Tools\"); // Create a menu with n ame \"Tools\"\\nJMenuItem drawCommand = new JMenuItem(\"Draw\"); // Create a menu item.\\ndrawCommand.addActionListener(listener); // Add listen er to menu item.\\ntoolsMenu.add(drawCommand); // Add menu item to menu.\\nJMenuItem eraseCommand = new JMenuItem(\"Erase\"); // Create a menu item.\\neraseCommand.addActionListener(listener); // Add liste ner to menu item.\\ntoolsMenu.add(eraseCommand); // Add menu item to menu.\\n.\\n. // Create and add other menu items.\\n.\\nOnce a menu has been created, it must be added to a menu bar. A me nu bar is represented\\nby the class JMenuBar. A menu bar is just a container for menus. It does not have a nam e,\\nand its constructor does not have any parameters. It has an add(JMenu) method that can be\\nused to add menus to the menu bar. F or example, the MosaicDraw program uses three menus,\\ncontrolMenu, colorMenu, and toolsMenu. W e could create a menu bar and add the menus to\\nit with the statements:\\nJMenuBar menuBar = new JMenuBar();\\nmenuBar.add(controlMenu);\\nmenuBar.add(colorMenu);\\nmenuBar.add(toolsMenu);\\nThe ﬁnal step in using menus is to use the menu bar in a JApplet or JFrame. W e have already\\nseen that an applet or frame has a “content pane.” The menu bar is another component of the\\napplet or frame, not contained inside the content pane. Both the JApplet and the JFrame\\nclasses include an instance method setMenuBar(JMenuBar) that can be used to set the menu\\nbar. (There can only be one, so this is a “set” method rather th an an “add” method.) In the\\nMosaicDraw program, the menu bar is created by a MosaicDrawController object and can be\\nobtained by calling that object’s getMenuBar() method. Here is the basic code that is used (in\\nsomewhat modiﬁed form) to set up the interface both in the app let and in the frame version of\\nthe program:\\nMosaicDrawController controller = new MosaicDrawController();\\nMoasicPanel content = controller.getMosaicPanel();\\nsetContentPane( content ); // Use panel from controller as c ontent pane.\\nJMenuBar menuBar = controller.getMenuBar();\\nsetJMenuBar( menuBar ); // Use the menu bar from the controll er.'),\n",

MENUS AND DIALOGS 299\\nUsing menus always follows the same general pattern: Create a menu bar. Create menus\\nand add them to the menu bar. Create menu items and add them to t he menus (and set up\\nlistening to handle action events from the menu items). Use t he menu bar in a JApplet or\\nJFrame by calling the setJMenuBar() method of the applet or frame.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThere are other kinds of menu items, deﬁned by subclasses of JMenuItem, that can be added\\nto menus. One of these is JCheckBoxMenuItem, which represents menu items that can be in one\\nof two states, selected or not selected. A JCheckBoxMenuItem has the same functionality and is\\nused in the same way as a JCheckBox (see Subsection 6.6.3). Three JCheckBoxMenuItems are\\nused in the “Control” menu of the MosaicDraw program. One can be used to turn the random\\ncolor variation of the squares on and oﬀ. Another turns a symm etry feature on and oﬀ; when\\nsymmetry is turned on, the user’s drawing is reﬂected horizo ntally and vertically to produce a\\nsymmetric pattern. And the third check box menu item shows an d hides the “grouting” in the\\nmosaic; the grouting is the gray lines that are drawn around e ach of the little squares in the\\nmosaic. The menu item that corresponds to the “Use Randomnes s” option in the “Control”\\nmenu could be set up with the statements:\\nJMenuItem useRandomnessToggle = new JCheckBoxMenuItem(\"Use Randomness\");\\nuseRandomnessToggle.addActionListener(listener); // S et up a listener.\\nuseRandomnessToggle.setSelected(true); // Randomness i s initially turned on.\\ncontrolMenu.add(useRandomnessToggle); // Add the menu it em to the menu.\\nThe “Use Randomness” JCheckBoxMenuItem corresponds to a boolean-valued instance vari-\\nable named useRandomness in the MosaicDrawController class. This variable is part of the state\\nof the controller object. Its value is tested whenever the us er draws one of the squares, to decide\\nwhether or not to add a random variation to the color of the squ are. When the user selects\\nthe “Use Randomness” command from the menu, the state of the JCheckBoxMenuItem is re-\\nversed, from selected to not-selected or from not-selected to selected. The ActionListener for\\nthe menu item checks whether the menu item is selected or not, and it changes the value of\\nuseRandomness to match. Note that selecting the menu command does not have a ny immediate\\neﬀect on the picture that is shown in the window. It just chang es the state of the program so\\nthat future drawing operations on the part of the user will ha ve a diﬀerent eﬀect. The “Use\\nSymmetry” option in the “Control” menu works in much the same way . The “Show Grouting”\\noption is a little diﬀerent. Selecting the “Show Grouting” o ption does have an immediate eﬀect:\\nThe picture is redrawn with or without the grouting, dependi ng on the state of the menu item.\\nMy program uses a single ActionListener to respond to all of the menu items in all the\\nmenus. This is not a particularly good design, but it is easy t o implement for a small program\\nlike this one. The actionPerformed() method of the listener object uses the statement\\nString command = evt.getActionCommand();\\nto get the action command of the source of the event; this will be the text of the menu item.\\nThe listener tests the value of command to determine which menu item was selected by the\\nuser. If the menu item is a JCheckBoxMenuItem, the listener must check the state of the menu\\nitem. Then menu item is the source of the event that is being pr ocessed. The listener can\\nget its hands on the menu item object by calling evt.getSource(). Since the return value of\\ngetSource() is Object, the the return value must be type-cast to the correct type. H ere, for\\nexample, is the code that handles the “Use Randomness” comma nd:\\nif (command.equals(\"Use Randomness\")) {\\n// Set the value of useRandomness depending on the menu item’s state.'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nJCheckBoxMenuItem toggle = (JCheckBoxMenuItem)evt.getSource();\\nuseRandomness = toggle.isSelected();\\n}\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nIn addition to menu items, a menu can contain lines that separ ate the menu items into\\ngroups. In the MosaicDraw program, the “Control” menu conta ins a separator. A JMenu has\\nan instance method addSeparator() that can be used to add a separator to the menu. F or\\nexample, the separator in the “Control” menu was created wit h the statement:\\ncontrolMenu.addSeparator();\\nA menu can also contain a submenu. The name of the submenu appe ars as an item in the\\nmain menu. When the user moves the mouse over the submenu name , the submenu pops up.\\n(There is no example of this in the MosaicDraw program.) It is very easy to do this in Java:\\nY ou can add one JMenu to another JMenu using a statement such as mainMenu.add(submenu).\\n6.8.2 Dialogs\\nOne of the commands in the “Color” menu of the MosaicDraw prog ram is “Custom Color. . . ”.\\nWhen the user selects this command, a new window appears wher e the user can select a color.\\nThis window is an example of a dialog or dialog box . A dialog is a type of window that is\\ngenerally used for short, single purpose interactions with the user. F or example, a dialog box\\ncan be used to display a message to the user, to ask the user a qu estion, to let the user select a\\nﬁle to be opened, or to let the user select a color. In Swing, a d ialog box is represented by an\\nobject belonging to the class JDialog or to a subclass.\\nThe JDialog class is very similar to JFrame and is used in much the same way . Like a\\nframe, a dialog box is a separate window. Unlike a frame, howe ver, a dialog is not completely\\nindependent. Every dialog is associated with a frame (or ano ther dialog), which is called\\nits parent window . The dialog box is dependent on its parent. F or example, if th e parent is\\nclosed, the dialog box will also be closed. It is possible to c reate a dialog box without specifying\\na parent, but in that case a an invisible frame is created by th e system to serve as the parent.\\nDialog boxes can be either modal or modeless. When a modal dialog is created, its parent\\nframe is blocked. That is, the user will not be able to interac t with the parent until the dialog\\nbox is closed. Modeless dialog boxes do not block their paren ts in the same way , so they seem\\na lot more like independent windows. In practice, modal dial og boxes are easier to use and are\\nmuch more common than modeless dialogs. All the examples we w ill look at are modal.\\nAside from having a parent, a JDialog can be created and used in the same way as a JFrame.\\nHowever, I will not give any examples here of using JDialog directly . Swing has many convenient\\nmethods for creating many common types of dialog boxes. F or e xample, the color choice dialog\\nthat appears when the user selects the “Custom Color” comman d in the MosaicDraw program\\nbelongs to the class JColorChooser, which is a subclass of JDialog. The JColorChooser class has\\na static method static method that makes color choice dialog s very easy to use:\\nColor JColorChooser.showDialog(Component parentComp,\\nString title, Color initialColor)\\nWhen you call this method, a dialog box appears that allows th e user to select a color. The\\nﬁrst parameter speciﬁes the parent of the dialog; the parent window of the dialog will be the\\nwindow (if any) that contains parentComp; this parameter can be null and it can itself be a\\nframe or dialog object. The second parameter is a string that appears in the title bar of the'),\n",

MENUS AND DIALOGS 301\\ndialog box. And the third parameter, initialColor, speciﬁes the color that is selected when\\nthe color choice dialog ﬁrst appears. The dialog has a sophis ticated interface that allows the\\nuser to change the selected color. When the user presses an “O K” button, the dialog box closes\\nand the selected color is returned as the value of the method. The user can also click a “Cancel”\\nbutton or close the dialog box in some other way; in that case, null is returned as the value\\nof the method. By using this predeﬁned color chooser dialog, you can write one line of code\\nthat will let the user select an arbitrary color. Swing also h as a JFileChooser class that makes\\nit almost as easy to show a dialog box that lets the user select a ﬁle to be opened or saved.\\nThe JOptionPane class includes a variety of methods for making simple dialog boxes that\\nare variations on three basic types: a “message” dialog, a “c onﬁrm” dialog, and an “input”\\ndialog. (The variations allow you to provide a title for the d ialog box, to specify the icon that\\nappears in the dialog, and to add other components to the dial og box. I will only cover the\\nmost basic forms here.) The on-line version of this section i ncludes an applet that demonstrates\\nJOptionPane as well as JColorChooser.\\nA message dialog simply displays a message string to the user . The user (hopefully) reads\\nthe message and dismisses the dialog by clicking the “OK” but ton. A message dialog can be\\nshown by calling the static method:\\nvoid JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(Component parentComp, String message)\\nThe message can be more than one line long. Lines in the messag e should be separated by\\nnewline characters, \\\\n. New lines will not be inserted automatically , even if the me ssage is very\\nlong.\\nAn input dialog displays a question or request and lets the us er type in a string as a response.\\nY ou can show an input dialog by calling:\\nString JOptionPane.showInputDialog(Component parentComp, String question)\\nAgain, the question can include newline characters. The dia log box will contain an input box,\\nan “OK” button, and a “Cancel” button. If the user clicks “Can cel”, or closes the dialog box\\nin some other way , then the return value of the method is null. If the user clicks “OK”, then\\nthe return value is the string that was entered by the user. No te that the return value can be\\nan empty string (which is not the same as a null value), if the user clicks “OK” without typing\\nanything in the input box. If you want to use an input dialog to get a numerical value from\\nthe user, you will have to convert the return value into a numb er; see Subsection 3.7.2.\\nFinally , a conﬁrm dialog presents a question and three respo nse buttons: “Y es”, “No”, and\\n“Cancel”. A conﬁrm dialog can be shown by calling:\\nint JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(Component parentComp, String question)\\nThe return value tells you the user’s response. It is one of th e following constants:\\n• JOptionPane.YES OPTION — the user clicked the “Y es” button\\n• JOptionPane.NO OPTION — the user clicked the “No” button\\n• JOptionPane.CANCEL OPTION — the user clicked the “Cancel” button\\n• JOptionPane.CLOSE OPTION — the dialog was closed in some other way .\\nBy the way , it is possible to omit the Cancel button from a conﬁ rm dialog by calling one of\\nthe other methods in the JOptionPane class. Just call:\\nJOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(\\nparent, question, title, JOptionPane.YES NO OPTION )'),\n",

The third parameter is a string that will be di splayed as the title of the dialog\\nbox window.\\nIf you would like to see how dialogs are created and used in the sample applet, you can ﬁnd\\nthe source code in the ﬁle SimpleDialogDemo.java.\\n6.8.3 Fine Points of F rames\\nIn previous sections, whenever I used a frame, I created a JFrame object in a main() routine\\nand installed a panel as the content pane of that frame. This w orks ﬁne, but a more object-\\noriented approach is to deﬁne a subclass of JFrame and to set up the contents of the frame\\nin the constructor of that class. This is what I did in the case of the MosaicDraw program.\\nMosaicDrawFrame is deﬁned as a subclass of JFrame. The deﬁnition of this class is very short,\\nbut it illustrates several new features of frames that I want to discuss:\\npublic class MosaicDrawFrame extends JFrame {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nJFrame window = new MosaicDrawFrame();\\nwindow.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT\\nON CLOSE);\\nwindow.setVisible(true);\\n}\\npublic MosaicDrawFrame() {\\nsuper(\"Mosaic Draw\");\\nMosaicDrawController controller = new MosaicDrawController();\\nsetContentPane( controller.getMosaicPanel() );\\nsetJMenuBar( controller.getMenuBar() );\\npack();\\nDimension screensize = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize();\\nsetLocation( (screensize.width - getWidth())/2,\\n(screensize.height - getHeight())/2 );\\n}\\n}\\nThe constructor in this class begins with the statement super(\"Mosaic Draw\"), which calls\\nthe constructor in the superclass, JFrame. The parameter speciﬁes a title that will appear in\\nthe title bar of the window. The next three lines of the constr uctor set up the contents of the\\nwindow; a MosaicDrawController is created, and the content pane and menu bar of the window\\nare obtained from the controller. The next line is something new. If window is a variable of\\ntype JFrame (or JDialog ), then the statement window.pack() will resize the window so that its\\nsize matches the preferred size of its contents. (In this cas e, of course, “ pack()” is equivalent\\nto “ this.pack()”; that is, it refers to the window that is being created by the constructor.)\\nThe pack() method is usually the best way to set the size of a window. Note that it will only\\nwork correctly if every component in the window has a correct preferred size. This is only a\\nproblem in two cases: when a panel is used as a drawing surface and when a panel is used as\\na container with a null layout manager. In both these cases there is no way for the sys tem to\\ndetermine the correct preferred size automatically , and yo u should set a preferred size by hand.\\nF or example:\\npanel.setPreferredSize( new Dimension(400, 250) );'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'AFPL Ghostscript 8.51', 'creator': 'dvips(k) 5.95b Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software', 'creationdate': 'D:20071115202101', 'moddate': 'D:20071115202101', 'title': 'javanotes.dvi', 'source': '../data/rag_data/javanotes5.pdf', 'total_pages': 699, 'page': 318, 'page_label': '319', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='6.8. MENUS AND DIALOGS 303\\nThe last two lines in the constructor position the window so t hat it is exactly centered on\\nthe screen. The line\\nDimension screensize = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize();\\ndetermines the size of the screen. The size of the screen is screensize.width pixels in the hor-\\nizontal direction and screensize.height pixels in the vertical direction. The setLocation()\\nmethod of the frame sets the position of the upper left corner of the frame on the screen. The\\nexpression “ screensize.width - getWidth()” is the amount of horizontal space left on the\\nscreen after subtracting the width of the window. This is div ided by 2 so that half of the empty\\nspace will be to the left of the window, leaving the other half of the space to the right of the\\nwindow. Similarly , half of the extra vertical space is above the window, and half is below.\\nNote that the constructor has created the window and set its s ize and position, but that\\nat the end of the constructor, the window is not yet visible on the screen. (More exactly , the\\nconstructor has created the window object, but the visual representation of that object on the\\nscreen has not yet been created.) T o show the window on the scr een, it will be necessary to\\ncall its instance method, window.setVisible(true).\\nIn addition to the constructor, the MosaicDrawFrame class includes a main() routine. This\\nmakes it possible to run MosaicDrawFrame as a stand-alone application. (The main() routine, as\\na static method, has nothing to do with the function of a MosaicDrawFrame object, and it could\\n(and perhaps should) be in a separate class.) The main() routine creates a MosaicDrawFrame\\nand makes it visible on the screen. It also calls\\nwindow.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT ON CLOSE);\\nwhich means that the program will end when the user closes the window. Note that this is not\\ndone in the constructor because doing it there would make MosaicDrawFrame less ﬂexible. It\\nwould be possible, for example, to write a program that lets t he user open multiple MosaicDraw\\nwindows. In that case, we don’t want to end the program just be cause the user has closed one\\nof the windows. F urthermore, it is possible for an applet to c reate a frame, which will open as\\na separate window on the screen. An applet is not allowed to “t erminate the program” (and\\nit’s not even clear what that should mean in the case of an appl et), and attempting to do so\\nwill produce an exception. There are other possible values f or the default close operation of a\\nwindow:\\n• JFrame.DO NOTHING ON CLOSE — the user’s attempts to close the window by clicking its\\nclose box will be ignored.\\n• JFrame.HIDE ON CLOSE — when the user clicks its close box, the window will be hidden\\njust as if window.setVisible(false) were called. The window can be made visible again\\nby calling window.setVisible(true). This is the value that is used if you do not specify\\nanother value by calling setDefaultCloseOperation.\\n• JFrame.DISPOSE ON CLOSE — the window is closed and any operating system resources\\nused by the window are released. It is not possible to make the window visible again.\\n(This is the proper way to permanently get rid of a window with out ending the program.\\nY ou can accomplish the same thing by calling the instance met hod window.dispose().)\\nI’ve written an applet version of the MosaicDraw program tha t appears on a W eb page as a\\nsingle button. When the user clicks the button, the applet op ens a MosaicDrawFrame. In this\\ncase, the applet sets the default close operation of the wind ow to JFrame.DISPOSE ON CLOSE.\\nY ou can try the applet in the on-line version of this section.'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nThe ﬁle MosaicDrawLauncherApplet.java contains the source code for the applet. One\\ninteresting point in the applet is that the text of the button changes depending on whether a\\nwindow is open or not. If there is no window, the text reads “La unch MosaicDraw”. When\\nthe window is open, it changes to “Close MosaicDraw”, and cli cking the button will close the\\nwindow. The change is implemented by attaching a WindowListener to the window. The listener\\nresponds to WindowEvents that are generated when the window opens and closes. Althou gh I\\nwill not discuss window events further here, you can look at t he source code for an example of\\nhow they can be used.\\n6.8.4 Creating Jar Files\\nAs the ﬁnal topic for this chapter, we look again at jar ﬁles. R ecall that a jar ﬁle is a “java\\narchive” that can contain a number of class ﬁles. When creati ng a program that uses more than\\none class, it’s usually a good idea to place all the classes th at are required by the program into\\na jar ﬁle, since then a user will only need that one ﬁle to run th e program. Subsection 6.2.4\\ndiscusses how a jar ﬁle can be used for an applet. Jar ﬁles can a lso be used for stand-alone\\napplications. In fact, it is possible to make a so-called executable jar ﬁle . A user can run an\\nexecutable jar ﬁle in much the same way as any other applicati on, usually by double-clicking\\nthe icon of the jar ﬁle. (The user’s computer must have a corre ct version of Java installed, and\\nthe computer must be conﬁgured correctly for this to work. Th e conﬁguration is usually done\\nautomatically when Java is installed, at least on Windows an d Mac OS.)\\nThe question, then, is how to create a jar ﬁle. The answer depe nds on what programming\\nenvironment you are using. The two basic types of programmin g environment—command line\\nand IDE—were discussed in Section 2.6. Any IDE (Integrated P rogramming Environment)\\nfor Java should have a command for creating jar ﬁles. In the Ec lipse IDE, for example, it’s\\ndone as follows: In the Package Explorer pane, select the pro gramming project (or just all the\\nindividual source code ﬁles that you need). Right-click on t he selection, and choose “Export”\\nfrom the menu that pops up. In the window that appears, select “JAR ﬁle” and click “Next”.\\nIn the window that appears next, enter a name for the jar ﬁle in the box labeled “JAR ﬁle”.\\n(Click the “Browse” button next to this box to select the ﬁle n ame using a ﬁle dialog box.) The\\nname of the ﬁle should end with “.jar”. If you are creating a re gular jar ﬁle, not an executable\\none, you can hit “Finish” at this point, and the jar ﬁle will be created. Y ou could do this, for\\nexample, if the jar ﬁle contains an applet but no main program . T o create an executable ﬁle,\\nhit the “Next” button twice to get to the “Jar Manifest Speciﬁcation” screen. At the bott om\\nof this screen is an input box labeled “Main class”. Y ou have t o enter the name of the class\\nthat contains the main() routine that will be run when the jar ﬁle is executed. If you hi t the\\n“Browse” button next to the “Main class” box, you can select t he class from a list of classes\\nthat contain main() routines. Once you’ve selected the main class, you can click the “Finish”\\nbutton to create the executable jar ﬁle.\\nIt is also possible to create jar ﬁles on the command line. The Java Development Kit\\nincludes a command-line program named jar that can be used to create jar ﬁles. If all your\\nclasses are in the default package (like the examples in this book), then the jar command is\\neasy to use. T o create a non-executable jar ﬁle on the command line, change to the directory\\nthat contains the class ﬁles that you want to include in the ja r. Then give the command\\njar cf JarFileName.jar *.class\\nwhere JarFileName can be any name that you want to use for the jar ﬁle. The “ *” in “ *.class”\\nis a wildcard that makes *.class match every class ﬁle in the current directory . This means'),\n",

If you want to include\\nonly certain class ﬁles, you can name them individually , sep arated by spaces. (Things get more\\ncomplicated if your classes are not in the default package. I n that case, the class ﬁles must be\\nin subdirectories of the directory in which you issue the jar ﬁle. See Subsection 2.6.4.)\\nMaking an executable jar ﬁle on the command line is a little mo re complicated. There has\\nto be some way of specifying which class contains the main() routine. This is done by creating\\na manifest ﬁle . The manifest ﬁle can be a plain text ﬁle containing a single l ine of the form\\nMain-Class: ClassName\\nwhere ClassName should be replaced by the name of the class that contains the main() routine.\\nF or example, if the main() routine is in the class MosaicDrawFrame, then the manifest ﬁle should\\nread “ Main-Class: MosaicDrawFrame ”. Y ou can give the manifest ﬁle any name you like.\\nPut it in the same directory where you will issue the jar command, and use a command of the\\nform\\njar cmf ManifestFileName JarFileName.jar *.class\\nto create the jar ﬁle. (The jar command is capable of performing a variety of diﬀerent opera -\\ntions. The ﬁrst parameter to the command, such as “ cf” or “ cmf”, tells it which operation to\\nperform.)\\nBy the way , if you have successfully created an executable ja r ﬁle, you can run it on the\\ncommand line using the command “ java -jar”.

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nExercises for Chapter 6\\n1. In the SimpleStamperPanel example from Subsection 6.4.2, a rectangle or oval is drawn o n\\nthe panel when the user clicks the mouse, except that when the user shift-clicks, the panel\\nis cleared instead. Modify this class so that the modiﬁed ver sion will continue to draw\\nﬁgures as the user drags the mouse. That is, the mouse will lea ve a trail of ﬁgures as the\\nuser drags the mouse. However, if the user shift-clicks, the panel should simply be cleared\\nand no ﬁgures should be drawn even if the user drags the mouse a fter shift-clicking. Use\\nyour panel either in an applet or in a stand-alone applicatio n (or both). Here is a picture\\nof my solution:\\nThe source code for the original panel class is SimpleStamperPanel.java. An applet\\nthat uses this class can be found in SimpleStamperApplet.java, and a main program that\\nuses the panel in a frame is in SimpleStamper.java. See the discussion of dragging in\\nSubsection 6.4.4. (Note that in the original version, I drew a black outline around each\\nshape. In the modiﬁed version, I decided that it would look be tter to draw a gray outline\\ninstead.)\\n2. W rite a panel that shows a small red square and a small blue squ are. The user should be\\nable to drag either square with the mouse. (Y ou’ll need an ins tance variable to remember\\nwhich square the user is dragging.) The user can drag the squa re oﬀ the applet if she\\nwants; if she does this, it’s gone. Use your panel in either an applet or a stand-alone\\napplication.\\n3. W rite a panel that shows a pair of dice. When the user clicks on the panel, the dice should\\nbe rolled (that is, the dice should be assigned newly compute d random values). Each die\\nshould be drawn as a square showing from 1 to 6 dots. Since you h ave to draw two dice,\\nits a good idea to write a subroutine, “ void drawDie(Graphics g, int val, int x,\\nint y)”, to draw a die at the speciﬁed (x,y) coordinates. The second parameter, val,\\nspeciﬁes the value that is showing on the die. Assume that the size of the panel is 100\\nby 100 pixels. Also write an applet that uses your panel as its content pane. Here is a\\npicture of the applet:'),\n",

In Exercise 6.3, you wrote a pair-of-dice panel where the dic e are rolled when the user\\nclicks on the panel Now make a pair-of-dice program in which t he user rolls the dice by\\nclicking a button. The button should appear under the panel t hat shows the dice. Also\\nmake the following change: When the dice are rolled, instead of just showing the new\\nvalue, show a short animation during which the values on the d ice are changed in every\\nframe. The animation is supposed to make the dice look more li ke they are actually rolling.\\nW rite your program as a stand-alone application.\\n5. In Exercise 3.6, you drew a checkerboard. F or this exercise, write a checkerboard applet\\nwhere the user can select a square by clicking on it. Hilite th e selected square by drawing\\na colored border around it. When the applet is ﬁrst created, n o square is selected. When\\nthe user clicks on a square that is not currently selected, it becomes selected. If the user\\nclicks the square that is selected, it becomes unselected. A ssume that the size of the applet\\nis exactly 160 by 160 pixels, so that each square on the checke rboard is 20 by 20 pixels.\\n6. F or this exercise, you should modify the SubKiller game from Subsection 6.5.4. Y ou can\\nstart with the existing source code, from the ﬁle SubKillerPanel.java. Modify the game\\nso it keeps track of the number of hits and misses and displays these quantities. That\\nis, every time the depth charge blows up the sub, the number of hits goes up by one.\\nEvery time the depth charge falls oﬀ the bottom of the screen w ithout hitting the sub, the\\nnumber of misses goes up by one. There is room at the top of the p anel to display these\\nnumbers. T o do this exercise, you only have to add a half-doze n lines to the source code.\\nBut you have to ﬁgure out what they are and where to add them. T o do this, you’ll have\\nto read the source code closely enough to understand how it wo rks.\\n7. Exercise 5.2 involved a class, StatCalc.java, that could compute some statistics of a set of\\nnumbers. W rite a program that uses the StatCalc class to compute and display statistics\\nof numbers entered by the user. The panel will have an instanc e variable of type StatCalc\\nthat does the computations. The panel should include a JT extField where the user enters\\na number. It should have four labels that display four statis tics for the numbers that have\\nbeen entered: the number of numbers, the sum, the mean, and th e standard deviation.\\nEvery time the user enters a new number, the statistics displ ayed on the labels should\\nchange. The user enters a number by typing it into the JT extField and pressing return.\\nThere should be a “Clear” button that clears out all the data. This means creating a new\\nStatCalc object and resetting the displays on the labels. My panel als o has an “Enter”\\nbutton that does the same thing as pressing the return key in t he JT extField. (Recall that\\na JT extField generates an ActionEvent when the user presses return, so your panel should\\nregister itself to listen for ActionEvents from the JT extField.)

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\n8. W rite a panel with a JT extArea where the user can enter some text. The panel should\\nhave a button. When the user clicks on the button, the panel sh ould count the number\\nof lines in the user’s input, the number of words in the user’s input, and the number of\\ncharacters in the user’s input. This information should be d isplayed on three labels in\\nthe panel. Recall that if textInput is a JT extArea, then you can get the contents of the\\nJT extArea by calling the function textInput.getText(). This function returns a String\\ncontaining all the text from the text area. The number of char acters is just the length\\nof this String. Lines in the String are separated by the new line character, ’\\\\n’, so the\\nnumber of lines is just the number of new line characters in th e String, plus one. W ords\\nare a little harder to count. Exercise 3.4 has some advice abo ut ﬁnding the words in a\\nString. Essentially , you want to count the number of characters tha t are ﬁrst characters\\nin words. Don’t forget to put your JT extArea in a JScrollPane, and add the scroll pane to\\nthe container, not the text area. Scrollbars should appear w hen the user types more text\\nthan will ﬁt in the available area. Here is a picture of my solu tion:\\n9. W rite a Blackjack program that lets the user play a game of Bla ckjack, with the computer\\nas the dealer. The applet should draw the user’s cards and the dealer’s cards, just as was\\ndone for the graphical HighLow card game in Subsection 6.7.6 . Y ou can use the source\\ncode for that game, HighLowGUI.java, for some ideas about how to write your Blackjack\\ngame. The structures of the HighLow panel and the Blackjack p anel are very similar.

Add the following\\nrule to that description: If a player takes ﬁve cards without going over 21, that player wins\\nimmediately . This rule is used in some casinos. F or your prog ram, it means that you only\\nhave to allow room for ﬁve cards. Y ou should assume that the pa nel is just wide enough\\nto show ﬁve cards, and that it is tall enough show the user’s ha nd and the dealer’s hand.\\nNote that the design of a GUI Blackjack game is very diﬀerent f rom the design of the\\ntext-oriented program that you wrote for Exercise 5.5. The u ser should play the game by\\nclicking on “Hit” and “Stand” buttons. There should be a “New Game” button that can\\nbe used to start another game after one game ends. Y ou have to d ecide what happens\\nwhen each of these buttons is pressed. Y ou don’t have much cha nce of getting this right\\nunless you think in terms of the states that the game can be in a nd how the state can\\nchange.\\nY our program will need the classes deﬁned in Card.java, Hand.java, Deck.java, and\\nBlackjackHand.java.\\n10. In the Blackjack game from Exercise 6.9, the user can click on the “Hit”, “Stand”, and\\n“NewGame” buttons even when it doesn’t make sense to do so. It would be better if the\\nbuttons were disabled at the appropriate times. The “New Gam e” button should be dis-\\nabled when there is a game in progress. The “Hit” and “Stand” b uttons should be disabled\\nwhen there is not a game in progress. The instance variable gameInProgress tells whether\\nor not a game is in progress, so you just have to make sure that t he buttons are properly\\nenabled and disabled whenever this variable changes value. I strongly advise writing a sub-\\nroutine that can be called whenever it is necessary to set the value of the gameInProgress\\nvariable. Then the subroutine can take responsibility for e nabling and disabling the but-\\ntons. Recall that if bttn is a variable of type JButton, then bttn.setEnabled(false)\\ndisables the button and bttn.setEnabled(true) enables the button.\\nAs a second (and more diﬃcult) improvement, make it possible for the user to place\\nbets on the Blackjack game. When the applet starts, give the u ser $100. Add a JT extField\\nto the strip of controls along the bottom of the applet. The us er can enter the bet in\\nthis JT extField. When the game begins, check the amount of the bet. Y ou should do this\\nwhen the game begins, not when it ends, because several error s can occur: The contents\\nof the JT extField might not be a legal number. The bet that the user places might be\\nmore money than the user has, or it might be <= 0. Y ou should detect these errors and\\nshow an error message instead of starting the game. The user’ s bet should be an integral\\nnumber of dollars.\\nIt would be a good idea to make the JT extField uneditable while the game is in progress.\\nIf betInput is the JT extField, you can make it editable and uneditable by the user with\\nthe commands betInput.setEditable(true) and betInput.setEditable(false).\\nIn the paintComponent() method, you should include commands to display the\\namount of money that the user has left.\\nThere is one other thing to think about: Ideally , the applet s hould not start a new\\ngame when it is ﬁrst created. The user should have a chance to s et a bet amount before\\nthe game starts. So, in the constructor for the drawing surfa ce class, you should not call\\ndoNewGame(). Y ou might want to display a message such as “W elcome to Black jack”\\nbefore the ﬁrst game starts.\\nHere is a picture of my program:'),\n",

A data\\nstructure is an organized collection of related data. An obj ect is a data structure, but this\\ntype of data structure—consisting of a fairly small number o f named instance variables—is just\\nthe beginning. In many cases, programmers build complicate d data structures by hand, by\\nlinking objects together. W e’ll look at these custom-built data structures in Chapter 9. But\\nthere is one type of data structure that is so important and so basic that it is built into every\\nprogramming language: the array .\\nAn array is a data structure consisting of a numbered list of items, wh ere all the items are\\nof the same type. In Java, the items in an array are always numb ered from zero up to some\\nmaximum value, which is set when the array is created. F or exa mple, an array might contain\\n100 integers, numbered from zero to 99. The items in an array c an belong to one of Java’s\\nprimitive types. They can also be references to objects, so t hat you could, for example, make\\nan array containing all the buttons in a GUI program.\\nThis chapter discusses how arrays are created and used in Jav a. It also covers the standard\\nclass java.util.ArrayList. An object of type ArrayList is very similar to an array of Objects,\\nbut it can grow to hold any number of items.\\n7.1 Creating and Using Arrays\\nWhen a number of data items are chunked together into a unit, the result is a data\\nstructure. Data structures can be very complex, but in many applicatio ns, the appropriate\\ndata structure consists simply of a sequence of data items. D ata structures of this simple variety\\ncan be either arrays or records.\\nThe term “record” is not used in Java. A record is essentially the same as a Java object\\nthat has instance variables only , but no instance methods. S ome other languages, which do not\\nsupport objects in general, nevertheless do support record s. The C programming language, for\\nexample, is not object-oriented, but it has records, which i n C go by the name “struct.” The\\ndata items in a record—in Java, an object’s instance variabl es—are called the ﬁelds of the\\nrecord. Each item is referred to using a ﬁeld name . In Java, ﬁeld names are just the names\\nof the instance variables. The distinguishing characteris tics of a record are that the data items\\nin the record are referred to by name and that diﬀerent ﬁelds i n a record are allowed to be of\\ndiﬀerent types. F or example, if the class Person is deﬁned as:\\nclass Person {\\nString name;\\n313'),\n",

ARRA YS\\nint id number;\\nDate birthday;\\nint age;\\n}\\nthen an object of class Person could be considered to be a record with four ﬁelds. The ﬁeld\\nnames are name, id\\nnumber, birthday, and age. Note that the ﬁelds are of various types:\\nString, int, and Date.\\nBecause records are just a special type of object, I will not d iscuss them further.\\n7.1.1 Arrays\\nLike a record, an array is a sequence of items. However, where items in a record are referred\\nto by name, the items in an array are numbered, and individual items are referred to by their\\nposition number . F urthermore, all the items in an array must be of the same typ e. The\\ndeﬁnition of an array is: a numbered sequence of items, which are all of the same type. The\\nnumber of items in an array is called the length of the array . The position number of an item\\nin an array is called the index of that item. The type of the individual items in an array is\\ncalled the base type of the array .\\nThe base type of an array can be any Java type, that is, one of th e primitive types, or a class\\nname, or an interface name. If the base type of an array is int, it is referred to as an “array of\\nints.” An array with base type String is referred to as an “array of Strings.” However, an array\\nis not, properly speaking, a list of integers or strings or ot her values. It is better thought of as\\na list of variables of type int, or of type String, or of some other type. As always, there is some\\npotential for confusion between the two uses of a variable: a s a name for a memory location\\nand as a name for the value stored in that memory location. Eac h position in an array acts as\\na variable. Each position can hold a value of a speciﬁed type ( the base type of the array). The\\nvalue can be changed at any time. V alues are stored in an array . The array is the container,\\nnot the values.\\nThe items in an array—really , the individual variables that make up the array—are more\\noften referred to as the elements of the array . In Java, the elements in an array are always\\nnumbered starting from zero. That is, the index of the ﬁrst el ement in the array is zero. If the\\nlength of the array is N, then the index of the last element in the array is N-1. Once an array\\nhas been created, its length cannot be changed.\\nJava arrays are objects. This has several consequences. Arrays are created using a f orm of\\nthe new operator. No variable can ever hold an array; a variable can only refer to an array .\\nAny variable that can refer to an array can also hold the value null, meaning that it doesn’t\\nat the moment refer to anything. Like any object, an array bel ongs to a class, which like all\\nclasses is a subclass of the class Object. The elements of the array are, essentially , instance\\nvariables in the array object, except that they are referred to by number rather than by name.\\nNevertheless, even though arrays are objects, there are diﬀ erences between arrays and other\\nkinds of objects, and there are a number of special language f eatures in Java for creating and\\nusing arrays.\\n7.1.2 Using Arrays\\nSuppose that A is a variable that refers to an array . Then the element at inde x k in A is referred\\nto as A[k]. The ﬁrst element is A[0], the second is A[1], and so forth. “ A[k]” is really a\\nvariable, and it can be used just like any other variable. Y ou can assign values to it, you can'),\n",

F or now, just keep in mind the syntax\\n⟨array-variable ⟩ [ ⟨integer-expression ⟩ ]\\nfor referring to an element of an array .\\nAlthough every array , as an object, belongs to some class, ar ray classes never have to be\\ndeﬁned. Once a type exists, the corresponding array class ex ists automatically . If the name\\nof the type is BaseT ype, then the name of the associated array class is BaseT ype[ ]. That is\\nto say , an object belonging to the class BaseT ype[ ]is an array of items, where each item is a\\nvariable of type BaseT ype. The brackets, “ []”, are meant to recall the syntax for referring to\\nthe individual items in the array . “ BaseT ype[ ]” is read as “array of BaseType” or “BaseType\\narray .” It might be worth mentioning here that if ClassA is a subclass of ClassB, then the class\\nClassA[ ] is automatically a subclass of ClassB[ ].\\nThe base type of an array can be any legal Java type. F rom the pr imitive type int, the\\narray type int[ ] is derived. Each element in an array of type int[ ] is a variable of type int, which\\nholds a value of type int. F rom a class named Shape, the array type Shape[ ] is derived. Each\\nitem in an array of type Shape[ ] is a variable of type Shape, which holds a value of type Shape.\\nThis value can be either null or a reference to an object belonging to the class Shape. (This\\nincludes objects belonging to subclasses of Shape.)\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nLet’s try to get a little more concrete about all this, using a rrays of integers as our ﬁrst\\nexample. Since int[ ] is a class, it can be used to declare variables. F or example,\\nint[] list;\\ncreates a variable named list of type int[ ]. This variable is capable of referring to an array\\nof ints, but initially its value is null (if list is a member variable in a class) or undeﬁned (if\\nlist is a local variable in a method). The new operator is used to create a new array object,\\nwhich can then be assigned to list. The syntax for using new with arrays is diﬀerent from the\\nsyntax you learned previously . As an example,\\nlist = new int[5];\\ncreates an array of ﬁve integers. More generally , the constr uctor “ new BaseType[N]” is used to\\ncreate an array belonging to the class BaseT ype[ ]. The value N in brackets speciﬁes the length\\nof the array , that is, the number of elements that it contains . Note that the array “knows”\\nhow long it is. The length of the array is an instance variable in the array object. In fact, the\\nlength of an array , list, can be referred to as list.length. (However, you are not allowed to\\nchange the value of list.length, so it’s really a “ final” instance variable, that is, one whose\\nvalue cannot be changed after it has been initialized.)\\nThe situation produced by the statement “ list = new int[5];” can be pictured like this:\\nl i s t : ( 5 )\\nl i s t . l e n g t h\\nl i s t [ 0 ]\\n0\\nl i s t [ 1 ]\\n0\\nl i s t [ 2 ]\\n0\\nl i s t [ 3 ]\\n0\\nl i s t [ 4 ]\\n0\\nT h e s t a t e m e n t\\n\" l i s t = n e w i n t [ 5 ] ; \"\\nc r\\ne a t e s a n a\\nr r\\na y\\nt h a t\\nc\\na n h o l d ﬁ v e\\ni n t s , a n d s e t s l i s t\\nt o\\nr\\ne f e\\nr\\nt o i t .\\nT h e a\\nr r\\na y o b j e\\nc\\nt\\nc\\no n t a i n s\\nﬁ v e i n t e g e\\nr\\ns , w h i\\nc\\nh a\\nr\\ne\\nr\\ne f e\\nr r\\ne d t o a s l i s t [ 0 ] , l i s t [ 1 ] ,\\na n d s o o n .

ARRA YS\\nNote that the newly created array of integers is automatical ly ﬁlled with zeros. In Java, a\\nnewly created array is always ﬁlled with a known, default value: zero for numbers, false for\\nboolean, the character with Unicode number zero for char, and null for objects.\\nThe elements in the array , list, are referred to as list[0], list[1], list[2], list[3],\\nand list[4]. (Note again that the index for the last item is one less than list.length.)\\nHowever, array references can be much more general than this . The brackets in an array\\nreference can contain any expression whose value is an integ er. F or example if indx is a\\nvariable of type int, then list[indx] and list[2*indx+7] are syntactically correct references\\nto elements of the array list. Thus, the following loop would print all the integers in the array ,\\nlist, to standard output:\\nfor (int i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {\\nSystem.out.println( list[i] );\\n}\\nThe ﬁrst time through the loop, i is 0, and list[i] refers to list[0]. So, it is the value\\nstored in the variable list[0] that is printed. The second time through the loop, i is 1, and\\nthe value stored in list[1] is printed. The loop ends after printing the value of list[4],\\nwhen i becomes equal to 5 and the continuation condition “ i < list.length” is no longer\\ntrue. This is a typical example of using a loop to process an ar ray . I’ll discuss more examples\\nof array processing throughout this chapter.\\nEvery use of a variable in a program speciﬁes a memory locatio n. Think for a moment\\nabout what the computer does when it encounters a reference t o an array element, list[k],\\nwhile it is executing a program. The computer must determine which memory location is being\\nreferred to. T o the computer, list[k] means something like this: “Get the pointer that is\\nstored in the variable, list. F ollow this pointer to ﬁnd an array object. Get the value of k.\\nGo to the k-th position in the array , and that’s the memory location you want.” There are two\\nthings that can go wrong here. Suppose that the value of list is null. If that is the case,\\nthen list doesn’t even refer to an array . The attempt to refer to an elem ent of an array that\\ndoesn’t exist is an error that will cause an exception of type NullPointerException to be thrown.\\nThe second possible error occurs if list does refer to an array , but the value of k is outside the\\nlegal range of indices for that array . This will happen if k < 0 or if k >= list.length. This\\nis called an “array index out of bounds” error. When an error o f this type occurs, an exception\\nof type ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. When you use arrays in a program, you\\nshould be mindful that both types of errors are possible. How ever, array index out of bounds\\nerrors are by far the most common error when working with arra ys.\\n7.1.3 Array Initialization\\nF or an array variable, just as for any variable, you can decla re the variable and initialize it in\\na single step. F or example,\\nint[] list = new int[5];\\nIf list is a local variable in a subroutine, then this is exactly equi valent to the two statements:\\nint[] list;\\nlist = new int[5];\\n(If list is an instance variable, then of course you can’t simply repl ace “ int[] list = new\\nint[5];” with “ int[] list; list = new int[5];” since the assignment statement “ list =\\nnew int[5];” is only legal inside a subroutine.)'),\n",

CREA TING AND USING ARRA YS 317\\nThe new array is ﬁlled with the default value appropriate for the base type of the array—zero\\nfor int and null for class types, for example. However, Java also provides a w ay to initialize an\\narray variable with a new array ﬁlled with a speciﬁed list of v alues. In a declaration statement\\nthat creates a new array , this is done with an array initializer . F or example,\\nint[] list = { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 };\\ncreates a new array containing the seven values 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 , 36, and 49, and sets list to\\nrefer to that new array . The value of list[0] will be 1, the value of list[1] will be 4, and so\\nforth. The length of list is seven, since seven values are provided in the initializer .\\nAn array initializer takes the form of a list of values, separ ated by commas and enclosed\\nbetween braces. The length of the array does not have to be spe ciﬁed, because it is implicit in\\nthe list of values. The items in an array initializer don’t ha ve to be constants. They can be\\nvariables or arbitrary expressions, provided that their va lues are of the appropriate type. F or\\nexample, the following declaration creates an array of eigh t Colors. Some of the colors are given\\nby expressions of the form “ new Color(r,g,b)” instead of by constants:\\nColor[] palette = {\\nColor.BLACK,\\nColor.RED,\\nColor.PINK,\\nnew Color(0,180,0), // dark green\\nColor.GREEN,\\nColor.BLUE,\\nnew Color(180,180,255), // light blue\\nColor.WHITE\\n};\\nA list initializer of this form can be used only in a declaration statement, to give an\\ninitial value to a newly declared array variable. It cannot b e used in an assignment statement\\nto assign a value to a variable that has been previously decla red. However, there is another,\\nsimilar notation for creating a new array that can be used in a n assignment statement or passed\\nas a parameter to a subroutine. The notation uses another for m of the new operator to both\\ncreate and initialize a new array object at the same time. (Th e rather odd syntax is similar to\\nthe syntax for anonymous classes, which were discussed in Su bsection 5.7.3.) F or example to\\nassign a new value to an array variable, list, that was declared previously , you could use:\\nlist = new int[] { 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343 };\\nThe general syntax for this form of the new operator is\\nnew ⟨base-type ⟩ [ ] { ⟨list-of-values ⟩ }\\nThis is actually an expression whose value is a reference to a newly created array object. This\\nmeans that it can be used in any context where an object of type ⟨base-type⟩[] is expected.\\nF or example, if makeButtons is a method that takes an array of Strings as a parameter, you\\ncould say:\\nmakeButtons( new String[] { \"Stop\", \"Go\", \"Next\", \"Previous\" } );\\nBeing able to create and use an array “in place” in this way can be very convenient, in the\\nsame way that anonymous nested classes are convenient.\\nBy the way , it is perfectly legal to use the “ new BaseType[] { ... }” syntax instead of\\nthe array initializer syntax in the declaration of an array v ariable. F or example, instead of\\nsaying:'),\n",

Two fundamental array processing techniques—searc hing and sorting—will be covered\\nin Section 7.4. This section introduces some of the basic ide as of array processing in general.\\n7.2.1 Arrays and for Loops\\nIn many cases, processing an array means applying the same op eration to each item in the\\narray . This is commonly done with a for loop. A loop for processing all the elements of an\\narray A has the form:\\n// do any necessary initialization\\nfor (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {\\n. . . // process A[i]\\n}\\nSuppose, for example, that A is an array of type double[ ]. Suppose that the goal is to add\\nup all the numbers in the array . An informal algorithm for doi ng this would be:\\nStart with 0;\\nAdd A[0]; (process the first item in A)\\nAdd A[1]; (process the second item in A)\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nAdd A[ A.length - 1 ]; (process the last item in A)\\nPutting the obvious repetition into a loop and giving a name t o the sum, this becomes:'),\n",

PROGRAMMING WITH ARRA YS 319\\ndouble sum; // The sum of the numbers in A.\\nsum = 0; // Start with 0.\\nfor (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++)\\nsum += A[i]; // add A[i] to the sum, for\\n// i = 0, 1, ..., A.length - 1\\nNote that the continuation condition, “ i < A.length”, implies that the last value of i that\\nis actually processed is A.length-1, which is the index of the ﬁnal item in the array . It’s\\nimportant to use “ <” here, not “ <=”, since “ <=” would give an array index out of bounds error.\\nThere is no element at position A.length in A.\\nEventually , you should just about be able to write loops simi lar to this one in your sleep.\\nI will give a few more simple examples. Here is a loop that will count the number of items in\\nthe array A which are less than zero:\\nint count; // For counting the items.\\ncount = 0; // Start with 0 items counted.\\nfor (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {\\nif (A[i] < 0.0) // if this item is less than zero...\\ncount++; // ...then count it\\n}\\n// At this point, the value of count is the number\\n// of items that have passed the test of being < 0\\nReplace the test “ A[i] < 0.0”, if you want to count the number of items in an array that\\nsatisfy some other property . Here is a variation on the same t heme. Suppose you want to count\\nthe number of times that an item in the array A is equal to the item that follows it. The item\\nthat follows A[i] in the array is A[i+1], so the test in this case is “ if (A[i] == A[i+1])”.\\nBut there is a catch: This test cannot be applied when A[i] is the last item in the array , since\\nthen there is no such item as A[i+1]. The result of trying to apply the test in this case would\\nbe an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. This just means that we have to stop one item short\\nof the ﬁnal item:\\nint count = 0;\\nfor (int i = 0; i < A.length - 1; i++) {\\nif (A[i] == A[i+1])\\ncount++;\\n}\\nAnother typical problem is to ﬁnd the largest number in A. The strategy is to go through\\nthe array , keeping track of the largest number found so far. W e’ll store the largest number\\nfound so far in a variable called max. As we look through the array , whenever we ﬁnd a number\\nlarger than the current value of max, we change the value of max to that larger value. After the\\nwhole array has been processed, max is the largest item in the array overall. The only question\\nis, what should the original value of max be? One possibility is to start with max equal to A[0],\\nand then to look through the rest of the array , starting from A[1], for larger items:\\ndouble max = A[0];\\nfor (int i = 1; i < A.length; i++) {\\nif (A[i] > max)\\nmax = A[i];\\n}\\n// at this point, max is the largest item in A'),\n",

ARRA YS\\n(There is one subtle problem here. It’s possible in Java for a n array to have length zero. In\\nthat case, A[0] doesn’t exist, and the reference to A[0] in the ﬁrst line gives an array index out\\nof bounds error. However, zero-length arrays are normally s omething that you want to avoid\\nin real problems. Anyway , what would it mean to ask for the lar gest item in an array that\\ncontains no items at all?)\\nAs a ﬁnal example of basic array operations, consider the pro blem of copying an array . T o\\nmake a copy of our sample array A, it is not suﬃcient to say\\ndouble[] B = A;\\nsince this does not create a new array object. All it does is de clare a new array variable and\\nmake it refer to the same object to which A refers. (So that, for example, a change to A[i] will\\nautomatically change B[i] as well.) T o make a new array that is a copy of A, it is necessary to\\nmake a new array object and to copy each of the individual item s from A into the new array:\\ndouble[] B = new double[A.length]; // Make a new array object,\\n// the same size as A.\\nfor (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++)\\nB[i] = A[i]; // Copy each item from A to B.\\nCopying values from one array to another is such a common oper ation that Java has a\\npredeﬁned subroutine to do it. The subroutine, System.arraycopy(), is a static member\\nsubroutine in the standard System class. Its declaration has the form\\npublic static void arraycopy(Object sourceArray, int sourceStartIndex,\\nObject destArray, int destStartIndex, int count)\\nwhere sourceArray and destArray can be arrays with any base type. V alues are copied from\\nsourceArray to destArray. The count tells how many elements to copy . V alues are taken from\\nsourceArray starting at position sourceStartIndex and are stored in destArray starting at\\nposition destStartIndex. F or example, to make a copy of the array , A, using this subroutine,\\nyou would say:\\ndouble B = new double[A.length];\\nSystem.arraycopy( A, 0, B, 0, A.length );\\n7.2.2 Arrays and for-each Loops\\nJava 5.0 introduced a new form of the for loop, the “for-each loop” that was introduced in\\nSubsection 3.4.4. The for-each loop is meant speciﬁcally fo r processing all the values in a data\\nstructure. When used to process an array , a for-each loop can be used to perform the same\\noperation on each value that is stored in the array . If anArray is an array of type BaseT ype[ ],\\nthen a for-each loop for anArray has the form:\\nfor ( BaseType item : anArray ) {\\n.\\n. // process the item\\n.\\n}\\nIn this loop, item is the loop control variable. It is being declared as a variab le of type BaseT ype,\\nwhere BaseT ype is the base type of the array . (In a for-each loop, the loop con trol variable must\\nbe declared in the loop.) When this loop is executed, each val ue from the array is assigned\\nto item in turn and the body of the loop is executed for each value. Thu s, the above loop is\\nexactly equivalent to:'),\n",

F or example, th ere is no simple way to use it\\nto process the items in just a part of an array . However, it doe s make it a little easier to process\\nall the values in an array , since it eliminates any need to use array indices.\\nIt’s important to note that a for-each loop processes the values in the array , not the\\nelements (where an element means the actual memory location that is pa rt of the array). F or\\nexample, consider the following incorrect attempt to ﬁll an array of integers with 17’s:\\nint[] intList = new int[10];\\nfor ( int item : intList ) { // INCORRECT! DOES NOT MODIFY THE ARRAY!\\nitem = 17;\\n}\\nThe assignment statement item = 17 assigns the value 17 to the loop control variable, item.\\nHowever, this has nothing to do with the array . When the body o f the loop is executed, the\\nvalue from one of the elements of the array is copied into item. The statement item = 17\\nreplaces that copied value but has no eﬀect on the array eleme nt from which it was copied; the\\nvalue in the array is not changed.\\n7.2.3 Array Types in Subroutines\\nAny array type, such as double[ ], is a full-ﬂedged Java type, so it can be used in all the ways\\nthat any other Java type can be used. In particular, it can be u sed as the type of a formal\\nparameter in a subroutine. It can even be the return type of a f unction. F or example, it might\\nbe useful to have a function that makes a copy of an array of double:\\n/**\\n* Create a new array of doubles that is a copy of a given array.\\n* @param source the array that is to be copied; the value can be null\\n* @return a copy of source; if source is null, then the return v alue is also null\\n*/\\npublic static double[] copy( double[] source ) {\\nif ( source == null )'),\n",

Y ou’ve seen this used\\nsince all the way back in Section 2.1, but I haven’t really bee n able to explain it until now.\\nThe parameter to the main() routine is an array of String s. When the system calls the main()\\nroutine, the strings in this array are the command-line arguments from the command that\\nwas used to run the program. When using a command-line interf ace, the user types a command\\nto tell the system to execute a program. The user can include e xtra input in this command,\\nbeyond the name of the program. This extra input becomes the c ommand-line arguments. F or\\nexample, if the name of the class that contains the main() routine is myProg, then the user\\ncan type “ java myProg” to execute the program. In this case, there are no command-l ine\\narguments. But if the user types the command\\njava myProg one two three\\nthen the command-line arguments are the strings “one”, “two ”, and “three”. The system puts\\nthese strings into an array of String s and passes that array as a parameter to the main()\\nroutine. Here, for example, is a short program that simply pr ints out any command line\\narguments entered by the user:\\npublic class CLDemo {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"You entered \" + args.length\\n+ \" command-line arguments\");\\nif (args.length > 0) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"They were:\");\\nfor (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++)\\nSystem.out.println(\" \" + args[i]);\\n}\\n} // end main()\\n} // end class CLDemo\\nNote that the parameter, args, is never null when main() is called by the system, but it might\\nbe an array of length zero.\\nIn practice, command-line arguments are often the names of ﬁ les to be processed by the\\nprogram. I will give some examples of this in Chapter 11, when I discuss ﬁle processing.\\n7.2.4 Random Access\\nSo far, all my examples of array processing have used sequential access . That is, the elements\\nof the array were processed one after the other in the sequenc e in which they occur in the array .\\nBut one of the big advantages of arrays is that they allow random access . That is, every\\nelement of the array is equally accessible at any given time.\\nAs an example, let’s look at a well-known problem called the b irthday problem: Suppose\\nthat there are N people in a room. What’s the chance that there are two people i n the room\\nwho have the same birthday? (That is, they were born on the sam e day in the same month,\\nbut not necessarily in the same year.) Most people severely u nderestimate the probability . W e'),\n",

How many people will you check bef ore you ﬁnd one who has the\\nsame birthday as someone you’ve already checked? Of course, the answer in a particular case\\ndepends on random factors, but we can simulate the experimen t with a computer program and\\nrun the program several times to get an idea of how many people need to be checked on average.\\nT o simulate the experiment, we need to keep track of each birt hday that we ﬁnd.

An applet version of\\nthe program can be found in the online version of this section .\\n7.2.5 Arrays of Objects\\nOne of the examples in Subsection 6.4.2 was an applet that sho ws multiple copies of a message\\nin random positions, colors, and fonts. When the user clicks on the applet, the positions, colors,\\nand fonts are changed to new random values. Like several othe r examples from that chapter,\\nthe applet had a ﬂaw: It didn’t have any way of storing the data that would be necessary to\\nredraw itself. Arrays provide us with one possible solution to this problem. W e can write a new\\nversion of the RandomStrings applet that uses an array to sto re the position, font, and color of\\neach string. When the content pane of the applet is painted, t his information is used to draw\\nthe strings, so the applet will paint itself correctly whene ver it has to be redrawn. When the\\nuser clicks on the applet, the array is ﬁlled with new random v alues and the applet is repainted\\nusing the new data. So, the only time that the picture will cha nge is in response to a mouse\\nclick.\\nIn this applet, the number of copies of the message is given by a named constant,\\nMESSAGE\\nCOUNT. One way to store the position, color, and font of MESSAGE COUNT strings would\\nbe to use four arrays:\\nint[] x = new int[MESSAGE COUNT];\\nint[] y = new int[MESSAGE COUNT];\\nColor[] color = new Color[MESSAGE COUNT];\\nFont[] font = new Font[MESSAGE COUNT];\\nThese arrays would be ﬁlled with random values. In the paintComponent() method, the i-th\\ncopy of the string would be drawn at the point (x[i],y[i]). Its color would be given by\\ncolor[i]. And it would be drawn in the font font[i]. This would be accomplished by the\\npaintComponent() method\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\\nsuper.paintComponent(); // (Fill with background color.)\\nfor (int i = 0; i < MESSAGE\\nCOUNT; i++) {\\ng.setColor( color[i] );\\ng.setFont( font[i] );\\ng.drawString( message, x[i], y[i] );\\n}\\n}\\nThis approach is said to use parallel arrays . The data for a given copy of the message is\\nspread out across several arrays. If you think of the arrays a s laid out in parallel columns—\\narray x in the ﬁrst column, array y in the second, array color in the third, and array font\\nin the fourth—then the data for the i-th string can be found along the the i-th row.

PROGRAMMING WITH ARRA YS 325\\nis nothing wrong with using parallel arrays in this simple ex ample, but it does go against the\\nobject-oriented philosophy of keeping related data in one o bject. If we follow this rule, then we\\ndon’t have to imagine the relationship among the data, because all the data for one copy of\\nthe message is physically in one place. So, when I wrote the ap plet, I made a simple class to\\nrepresent all the data that is needed for one copy of the messa ge:\\n/**\\n* An object of this type holds the position, color, and font\\n* of one copy of the string.\\n*/\\nprivate static class StringData {\\nint x, y; // The coordinates of the left end of baseline of stri ng.\\nColor color; // The color in which the string is drawn.\\nFont font; // The font that is used to draw the string.\\n}\\n(This class is actually deﬁned as a static nested class in the main applet class.) T o store the data\\nfor multiple copies of the message, I use an array of type StringData[ ]. The array is declared\\nas an instance variable, with the name stringData:\\nStringData[] stringData;\\nOf course, the value of stringData is null until an actual array is created and assigned to it.\\nThis is done in the init() method of the applet with the statement\\nstringData = new StringData[MESSAGE\\nCOUNT];\\nThe base type of this array is StringData, which is a class. W e say that stringData is an array\\nof objects . This means that the elements of the array are variables of ty pe StringData. Like\\nany object variable, each element of the array can either be null or can hold a reference to an\\nobject. (Note that the term “array of objects” is a little mis leading, since the objects are not\\nin the array; the array can only contain references to object s). When the stringData array is\\nﬁrst created, the value of each element in the array is null.\\nThe data needed by the RandomStrings program will be stored i n objects of type StringData,\\nbut no such objects exist yet. All we have so far is an array of v ariables that are capable of\\nreferring to such objects. I decided to create the StringData objects in the applet’s init method.\\n(It could be done in other places—just so long as we avoid tryi ng to use an object that doesn’t\\nexist. This is important: Remember that a newly created arra y whose base type is an object\\ntype is always ﬁlled with null elements. There are no objects in the array until you put them\\nthere.) The objects are created with the for loop\\nfor (int i = 0; i < MESSAGE COUNT; i++)\\nstringData[i] = new StringData();\\nF or the RandomStrings applet, the idea is to store data for th e i-th copy of the\\nmessage in the variables stringData[i].x, stringData[i].y, stringData[i].color, and\\nstringData[i].font. Make sure that you understand the notation here: stringData[i]\\nrefers to an object. That object contains instance variable s. The notation stringData[i].x\\ntells the computer: “Find your way to the object that is refer red to by stringData[i]. Then\\ngo to the instance variable named x in that object.” V ariable names can get even more com-\\nplicated than this, so it is important to learn how to read the m.

In fact, the preceding four\\nlines could be replaced by the single line:\\nFont randomFont = fonts[ (int)(Math.random() * 5) ];\\nThis is a very typical application of arrays. Note that this e xample uses the random access\\nproperty of arrays: W e can pick an array index at random and go directly to the array element\\nat that index.\\nHere is another example of the same sort of thing. Months are o ften stored as numbers 1, 2,\\n3, . . . , 12. Sometimes, however, these numbers have to be tran slated into the names January ,\\nF ebruary , . . . , December. The translation can be done with an array .

Before version 5.0,\\nevery method in Java had a ﬁxed arity . (The arity of a subroutine is deﬁned as the number of\\nparameters in a call to the method.) In a ﬁxed arity method, th e number of parameters must\\nbe the same in every call to the method. Java 5.0 introduced variable arity methods . In a'),\n",

ARRA YS\\nvariable arity method, diﬀerent calls to the method can have diﬀerent numbers of parameters.\\nF or example, the formatted output method System.out.printf, which was introduced in Sub-\\nsection 2.4.4, is a variable arity method. The ﬁrst paramete r of System.out.printf must be\\na String, but it can have any number of additional parameters, of any t ypes.\\nCalling a variable arity method is no diﬀerent from calling a ny other sort of method, but\\nwriting one requires some new syntax. As an example, conside r a method that can compute\\nthe average of any number of values of type double. The deﬁnition of such a method could\\nbegin with:\\npublic static double average( double... numbers ) {\\nHere, the ... after the type name, double, indicates that any number of values of type\\ndouble can be provided when the subroutine is called, so that for exa mple average(1,2,3),\\naverage(3.14,2.17), average(0.375), and even average() are all legal calls to this method.\\nNote that actual parameters of type int can be passed to average. The integers will, as usual,\\nbe automatically converted to real numbers.\\nWhen the method is called, the values of all the actual parame ters that correspond to the\\nvariable arity parameter are placed into an array , and it is t his array that is actually passed to\\nthe method. That is, in the body of a method, a variable arity p arameter of type T actually\\nlooks like an ordinary parameter of type T[ ]. The length of the array tells you how many\\nactual parameters were provided in the method call. In the average example, the body of the\\nmethod would see an array named numbers of type double[ ]. The number of actual parameters\\nin the method call would be numbers.length, and the values of the actual parameters would\\nbe numbers[0], numbers[1], and so on. A complete deﬁnition of the method would be:\\npublic static double average( double... numbers ) {\\ndouble sum; // The sum of all the actual parameters.\\ndouble average; // The average of all the actual parameters.\\nsum = 0;\\nfor (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\\nsum = sum + numbers[i]; // Add one of the actual parameters to t he sum.\\n}\\naverage = sum / numbers.length;\\nreturn average;\\n}\\nNote that the “ ...” can be applied only to the last formal parameter in a method deﬁnition.\\nNote also that it is possible to pass an actual array to the met hod, instead of a list of individual\\nvalues. F or example, if salesData is a variable of type double[ ], then it would be legal to call\\naverage(salesData), and this would compute the average of all the numbers in the a rray .\\nAs another example, consider a method that can draw a polygon through any number of\\npoints. The points are given as values of type Point, where an object of type Point has two\\ninstance variables, x and y, of type int. In this case, the method has one ordinary parameter—\\nthe graphics context that will be used to draw the polygon—in addition to the variable arity\\nparameter:\\npublic static void drawPolygon(Graphics g, Point... points) {\\nif (points.length > 1) { // (Need at least 2 points to draw anyt hing.)\\nfor (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {\\n// Draw a line from i-th point to (i+1)-th point\\ng.drawline( points[i].x, points[i].y, points[i+1].x, points[i+1].y );\\n}'),\n",

Even primiti ve type values are allowed, because\\nof autoboxing. (A primitive type value belonging to a type su ch as int is converted to an object\\nbelonging to a “wrapper” class such as Integer. See Subsection 5.3.2.) F or example, the method\\ndeﬁnition for System.out.printf could begin:\\npublic void printf(String format, Object... values) {\\nThis allows the printf method to output values of any type. Similarly , we could writ e a method\\nthat strings together the string representations of all its parameters into one long string:\\npublic static String concat( Object... values ) {\\nString str = \"\"; // Start with an empty string.\\nfor ( Object obj : values ) { // A \"for each\" loop for processing the values.\\nif (obj == null )\\nstr = str + \"null\"; // Represent null values by \"null\".\\nelse\\nstr = str + obj.toString();\\n}\\n}\\n7.3 Dynamic Arrays and ArrayLists\\nThe size of an arrayis ﬁxed when it is created. In many cases, however, the number of data\\nitems that are actually stored in the array varies with time. Consider the following examples:\\nAn array that stores the lines of text in a word-processing pr ogram. An array that holds the list\\nof computers that are currently downloading a page from a W eb site. An array that contains\\nthe shapes that have been added to the screen by the user of a dr awing program. Clearly , we\\nneed some way to deal with cases where the number of data items in an array is not ﬁxed.\\n7.3.1 Partially F ull Arrays\\nConsider an application where the number of items that we wan t to store in an array changes\\nas the program runs. Since the size of the array can’t actuall y be changed, a separate counter\\nvariable must be used to keep track of how many spaces in the ar ray are in use. (Of course,\\nevery space in the array has to contain something; the questi on is, how many spaces contain\\nuseful or valid items?)\\nConsider, for example, a program that reads positive intege rs entered by the user and stores\\nthem for later processing. The program stops reading when th e user inputs a number that is\\nless than or equal to zero. The input numbers can be kept in an a rray , numbers, of type int[ ].\\nLet’s say that no more than 100 numbers will be input. Then the size of the array can be ﬁxed\\nat 100. But the program must keep track of how many numbers hav e actually been read and\\nstored in the array . F or this, it can use an integer variable, numCount. Each time a number\\nis stored in the array , numCount must be incremented by one. As a rather silly example, let’s\\nwrite a program that will read the numbers input by the user an d then print them in reverse'),\n",

(This is, at least, a processing task that requires th at the numbers be saved in an array .\\nRemember that many types of processing, such as ﬁnding the su m or average or maximum of\\nthe numbers, can be done without saving the individual numbe rs.)\\npublic class ReverseInputNumbers {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nint[] numbers; // An array for storing the input values.\\nint numCount; // The number of numbers saved in the array.\\nint num; // One of the numbers input by the user.\\nnumbers = new int[100]; // Space for 100 ints.\\nnumCount = 0; // No numbers have been saved yet.\\nTextIO.putln(\"Enter up to 100 positive integers; enter 0 to end.\");\\nwhile (true) { // Get the numbers and put them in the array.\\nTextIO.put(\"? \");\\nnum = TextIO.getlnInt();\\nif (num <= 0)\\nbreak;\\nnumbers[numCount] = num;\\nnumCount++;\\n}\\nTextIO.putln(\"\\\\nYour numbers in reverse order are:\\\\n\");\\nfor (int i = numCount - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\\nTextIO.putln( numbers[i] );\\n}\\n} // end main();\\n} // end class ReverseInputNumbers\\nIt is especially important to note that the variable numCount plays a dual role. It is the\\nnumber of items that have been entered into the array . But it i s also the index of the next\\navailable spot in the array . F or example, if 4 numbers have be en stored in the array , they occupy\\nlocations number 0, 1, 2, and 3. The next available spot is loc ation 4. When the time comes to\\nprint out the numbers in the array , the last occupied spot in t he array is location numCount -\\n1, so the for loop prints out values starting from location numCount - 1 and going down to 0.\\nLet’s look at another, more realistic example. Suppose that you write a game program, and\\nthat players can join the game and leave the game as it progres ses. As a good object-oriented\\nprogrammer, you probably have a class named Player to represent the individual players in\\nthe game. A list of all players who are currently in the game co uld be stored in an array ,\\nplayerList, of type Player[ ]. Since the number of players can change, you will also need a\\nvariable, playerCt, to record the number of players currently in the game. Assum ing that there\\nwill never be more than 10 players in the game, you could decla re the variables as:\\nPlayer[] playerList = new Player[10]; // Up to 10 players.\\nint playerCt = 0; // At the start, there are no players.\\nAfter some players have joined the game, playerCt will be greater than 0, and\\nthe player objects representing the players will be stored i n the array elements\\nplayerList[0], playerList[1], . . . , playerList[playerCt-1]. Note that the array element'),\n",

The procedure for adding a new player, newPlayer, to\\nthe game is simple:\\nplayerList[playerCt] = newPlayer; // Put new player in next\\n// available spot.\\nplayerCt++; // And increment playerCt to count the new playe r.\\nDeleting a player from the game is a little harder, since you d on’t want to leave a “hole”\\nin the array . Suppose you want to delete the player at index k in playerList. If you are not\\nworried about keeping the players in any particular order, t hen one way to do this is to move\\nthe player from the last occupied position in the array into p osition k and then to decrement\\nthe value of playerCt:\\nplayerList[k] = playerList[playerCt - 1];\\nplayerCt--;\\nThe player previously in position k is no longer in the array . The player previously in position\\nplayerCt - 1 is now in the array twice. But it’s only in the occupied or vali d part of the array\\nonce, since playerCt has decreased by one. Remember that every element of the arra y has to\\nhold some value, but only the values in positions 0 through playerCt - 1 will be looked at or\\nprocessed in any way . (By the way , you should think about what happens if the player that\\nis being deleted is in the last position in the list. The code d oes still work in this case. What\\nexactly happens?)\\nSuppose that when deleting the player in position k, you’d like to keep the remaining players\\nin the same order. (Maybe because they take turns in the order in which they are stored in the\\narray .) T o do this, all the players in positions k+1 and above must move down one position in\\nthe array . Player k+1 replaces player k, who is out of the game. Player k+2 ﬁlls the spot left\\nopen when player k+1 is moved. And so on. The code for this is\\nfor (int i = k+1; i < playerCt; i++) {\\nplayerList[i-1] = playerList[i];\\n}\\nplayerCt--;\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nIt’s worth emphasizing that the Player example deals with an array whose base type is a\\nclass. An item in the array is either null or is a reference to an object belonging to the class,\\nPlayer. The Player objects themselves are not really stored in the array , only r eferences to\\nthem. Note that because of the rules for assignment in Java, t he objects can actually belong to\\nsubclasses of Player. Thus there could be diﬀerent classes of players such as comp uter players,\\nregular human players, players who are wizards, . . . , all rep resented by diﬀerent subclasses of\\nPlayer.\\nAs another example, suppose that a class Shape represents the general idea of a shape\\ndrawn on a screen, and that it has subclasses to represent spe ciﬁc types of shapes such as\\nlines, rectangles, rounded rectangles, ovals, ﬁlled-in ov als, and so forth.

Each object knows how to redraw itself, so that r epeated\\nexecutions of the statement can produce a variety of diﬀeren t shapes on the screen. This is nice\\nexample both of polymorphism and of array processing.\\n7.3.2 Dynamic Arrays\\nIn each of the above examples, an arbitrary limit was set on th e number of items—100 ints, 10\\nPlayers, 100 Shapes. Since the size of an array is ﬁxed, a given array can only hold a certain\\nmaximum number of items. In many cases, such an arbitrary lim it is undesirable. Why should\\na program work for 100 data values, but not for 101? The obviou s alternative of making an\\narray that’s so big that it will work in any practical case is n ot usually a good solution to the\\nproblem. It means that in most cases, a lot of computer memory will be wasted on unused space\\nin the array . That memory might be better used for something e lse. And what if someone is\\nusing a computer that could handle as many data values as the u ser actually wants to process,\\nbut doesn’t have enough memory to accommodate all the extra s pace that you’ve allocated for\\nyour huge array?\\nClearly , it would be nice if we could increase the size of an ar ray at will. This is not possible,\\nbut what is possible is almost as good. Remember that an array variable d oes not actually\\nhold an array . It just holds a reference to an array object. W e can’t make the array bigger,\\nbut we can make a new, bigger array object and change the value of the array variable so that\\nit refers to the bigger array . Of course, we also have to copy t he contents of the old array into\\nthe new array . The array variable then refers to an array obje ct that contains all the data of\\nthe old array , with room for additional data. The old array wi ll be garbage collected, since it\\nis no longer in use.\\nLet’s look back at the game example, in which playerList is an array of type Player[ ] and\\nplayerCt is the number of spaces that have been used in the array . Suppo se that we don’t\\nwant to put a pre-set limit on the number of players. If a new pl ayer joins the game and the'),\n",

Note that after this is done, playerList[0] will refer to a diﬀerent memory\\nlocation, but the value stored in playerList[0] will still be the same as it was before.

However, if we want to store Shapes instead of ints, we would have\\nto deﬁne a new class to do it. That class, probably named “ DynamicArrayOfShape ”, would look\\nexactly the same as the DynamicArrayOfInt class except that everywhere the type “ int” appears,\\nit would be replaced by the type “ Shape ”. Similarly , we could deﬁne a DynamicArrayOfDouble\\nclass, a DynamicArrayOfPlayer class, and so on. But there is something a little silly about t his,\\nsince all these classes are close to being identical. It woul d be nice to be able to write some\\nkind of source code, once and for all, that could be used to gen erate any of these classes on\\ndemand, given the type of value that we want to store. This wou ld be an example of generic\\nprogramming. Some programming languages, including C++, have had suppo rt for generic\\nprogramming for some time. With version 5.0, Java introduce d true generic programming,\\nbut even before that it had something that was very similar: O ne can come close to generic\\nprogramming in Java by working with data structures that con tain elements of type Object.\\nW e will ﬁrst consider the almost-generic programming that h as been available in Java from\\nthe beginning, and then we will look at the change that was int roduced in Java 5.0. A full\\ndiscussion of generic programming will be given in Chapter 1 0.\\nIn Java, every class is a subclass of the class named Object. This means that every object can\\nbe assigned to a variable of type Object. Any object can be put into an array of type Object[ ].\\nIf we deﬁned a DynamicArrayOfObject class, then we could store objects of any type. This is not\\ntrue generic programming, and it doesn’t apply to the primit ive types such as int and double.\\nBut it does come close. In fact, there is no need for us to deﬁne a DynamicArrayOfObject class.\\nJava already has a standard class named ArrayList that serves much the same purpose. The\\nArrayList class is in the package java.util, so if you want to use it in a program, you should\\nput the directive “ import java.util.ArrayList;” at the beginning of your source code ﬁle.\\nThe ArrayList class diﬀers from my DynamicArrayOfInt class in that an ArrayList object\\nalways has a deﬁnite size, and it is illegal to refer to a posit ion in the ArrayList that lies outside\\nits size. In this, an ArrayList is more like a regular array . However, the size of an ArrayList can\\nbe increased at will. The ArrayList class deﬁnes many instance methods. I’ll describe some of\\nthe most useful. Suppose that list is a variable of type ArrayList. Then we have:'),\n",

The integer N must be in the range from 0 to\\nlist.size()-1. A call to this function is equivalent to the command A[N] = obj for an\\narray A.\\n• list.remove(obj) — If the speciﬁed object occurs somewhere in the ArrayList, it is\\nremoved from the list. Any items in the list that come after th e removed item are moved\\ndown one position. The size of the ArrayList decreases by 1. If obj occurs more than once\\nin the list, only the ﬁrst copy is removed.\\n• list.remove(N) — F or an integer, N, this removes the N-th item in the ArrayList. N must\\nbe in the range 0 to list.size()-1. Any items in the list that come after the removed\\nitem are moved down one position. The size of the ArrayList decreases by 1.\\n• list.indexOf(obj) — A function that searches for the object, obj, in the ArrayList.

This variable\\nwould be declared as\\nArrayList players;\\nand initialized to refer to a new, empty ArrayList object with\\nplayers = new ArrayList();\\nIf newPlayer is a variable that refers to a Player object, the new player would be added to the\\nArrayList and to the game by saying\\nplayers.add(newPlayer);\\nand if player number i leaves the game, it is only necessary to say\\nplayers.remove(i);\\nOr, if player is a variable that refers to the Player that is to be removed, you could say\\nplayers.remove(player);\\nAll this works very nicely .

The obje cts that are stored in the list\\nbelong to a static nested class, ColoredRect, that is deﬁned as\\n/**\\n* An object of type ColoredRect holds the data for one colored rectangle.\\n*/\\nprivate static class ColoredRect {\\nint x,y; // Upper left corner of the rectangle.\\nint width,height; // Size of the rectangle.\\nColor color; // Color of the rectangle.\\n}'),\n",

DYNAMIC ARRA YS AND ARRA YLISTS 339\\n7.3.4 Parameterized Types\\nThe main diﬀerence between true generic programming and the ArrayList examples in the\\nprevious subsection is the use of the type Object as the basic type for objects that are stored\\nin a list. This has at least two unfortunate consequences: Fi rst, it makes it necessary to use\\ntype-casting in almost every case when an element is retriev ed from that list. Second, since\\nany type of object can legally be added to the list, there is no way for the compiler to detect\\nan attempt to add the wrong type of object to the list; the erro r will be detected only at run\\ntime when the object is retrieved from the list and the attemp t to type-cast the object fails.\\nCompare this to arrays. An array of type BaseT ype[ ]can only hold objects of type BaseT ype.\\nAn attempt to store an object of the wrong type in the array wil l be detected by the compiler,\\nand there is no need to type-cast items that are retrieved fro m the array back to type BaseT ype.\\nT o address this problem, Java 5.0 introduced parameterized types . ArrayList is an ex-\\nample: Instead of using the plain “ArrayList” type, it is pos sible to use ArrayList<BaseT ype>,\\nwhere BaseT ype is any object type, that is, the name of a class or of an interfa ce. ( BaseT ype\\ncannot be one of the primitive types.) ArrayList<BaseT ype> can be used to create lists that\\ncan hold only objects of type BaseT ype. F or example,\\nArrayList<ColoredRect> rects;\\ndeclares a variable named rects of type ArrayList<ColoredRect>, and\\nrects = new ArrayList<ColoredRect>();\\nsets rects to refer to a newly created list that can only hold objects bel onging to the class\\nColoredRect (or to a subclass). The funny-looking name “ArrayList <ColoredRect>” is being\\nused here in exactly the same way as an ordinary class name—do n’t let the “ <ColoredRect>”\\nconfuse you; it’s just part of the name of the type. When a stat ement such as rects.add(x);\\noccurs in the program, the compiler can check whether x is in fact of type ColoredRect. If not,\\nthe compiler will report a syntax error. When an object is ret rieve from the list, the compiler\\nknows that the object must be of type ColoredRect, so no type-cast is necessary . Y ou can say\\nsimply:\\nColoredRect rect = rects.get(i)\\nY ou can even refer directly to an instance variable in the obj ect, such as rects.get(i).color.\\nThis makes using ArrayList<ColoredRect> very similar to using ColoredRect[ ] with the added\\nadvantage that the list can grow to any size. Note that if a for -each loop is used to process the\\nitems in rects, the type of the loop control variable can be ColoredRect, and no type-cast is\\nnecessary . F or example, when using ArrayList<ColoredRect> as the type for the list rects, the\\ncode for drawing all the rectangles in the list could be rewri tten as:\\nfor ( ColoredRect rect : rects ) {\\ng.setColor( rect.color );\\ng.fillRect( rect.x, rect.y, rect.width, rect.height);\\ng.setColor( Color.BLACK );\\ng.drawRect( rect.x, rect.y, rect.width - 1, rect.height - 1);\\n}\\nY ou can use ArrayList<ColoredRect> anyplace where you could use a normal type: to declare\\nvariables, as the type of a formal parameter in a subroutine, or as the return type of a subroutine.\\nY ou can even create a subclass of ArrayList<ColoredRect>! (Nevertheless, technically speaking,\\nArrayList<ColoredRect> is not considered to be a separate class from ArrayList. An object of'),\n",

ARRA YS\\ntype ArrayList<ColoredRect> actually belongs to the class ArrayList, but the compiler restricts\\nthe type of objects that can be added to the list.)\\nThe only drawback to using parameterized types is that the ba se type cannot be a primitive\\ntype. F or example, there is no such thing as “ ArrayList<int>”. However, this is not such a\\nbig drawback as it might seem at ﬁrst, because of the “wrapper types” and “autoboxing” that\\nwere introduced in Subsection 5.3.2. A wrapper type such as Double or Integer can be used as\\na base type for a parameterized type. An object of type ArrayList<Double> can hold objects of\\ntype Double. Since each object of type Double holds a value of type double, it’s almost like\\nhaving a list of doubles. If numlist is declared to be of type ArrayList<Double> and if x is of\\ntype double, then the value of x can be added to the list by saying:\\nnumlist.add( new Double(x) );\\nF urthermore, because of autoboxing, the compiler will auto matically do double-to-Double and\\nDouble-to-double type conversions when necessary . This means that the compil er will treat\\n“ numlist.add(x)” as begin equivalent to “ numlist.add( new Double(x) )”. So, behind the\\nscenes, “ numlist.add(x)” is actually adding an object to the list, but it looks a lot as if you\\nare working with a list of doubles.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe sample program SimplePaint2.java demonstrates the use of parameterized types. In\\nthis program, the user can sketch curves in a drawing area by c licking and dragging with the\\nmouse. The curves can be of any color, and the user can select t he drawing color using a menu.\\nThe background color of the drawing area can also be selected using a menu. And there is a\\n“Control” menu that contains several commands: An “Undo” co mmand, which removes the\\nmost recently drawn curve from the screen, a “Clear” command that removes all the curves,\\nand a “Use Symmetry” command that turns a symmetry feature on and oﬀ. Curves that are\\ndrawn by the user when the symmetry option is on are reﬂected h orizontally and vertically\\nto produce a symmetric pattern. Y ou can try an applet version of the program in the on-line\\nversion of this section.\\nUnlike the original SimplePaint program in Subsection 6.4. 4, this new version uses a data\\nstructure to store information about the picture that has be en drawn by the user. This data\\nis used in the paintComponent() method to redraw the picture whenever necessary . Thus, the\\npicture doesn’t disappear when, for example, the picture is covered and then uncovered. The\\ndata structure is implemented using ArrayLists.\\nThe main data for a curve consists of a list of the points on the curve. This data can be stored\\nin an object of type ArrayList<Point>, where java.awt.Point is one of Java’s standard classes.\\n(A Point object contains two public integer variables x and y that represent the coordinates of\\na point.) However, to redraw the curve, we also need to know it s color, and we need to know\\nwhether the symmetry option should be applied to the curve. A ll the data that is needed to\\nredraw the curve can be grouped into an object of type CurveData that is deﬁned as\\nprivate static class CurveData {\\nColor color; // The color of the curve.\\nboolean symmetric; // Are horizontal and vertical reflecti ons also drawn?\\nArrayList<Point> points; // The points on the curve.\\n}\\nHowever, a picture can contain many curves, not just one, so t o store all the data necessary to\\nredraw the entire picture, we need a list of objects of type CurveData. F or this list, we can use\\na variable curves declared as'),\n",

DYNAMIC ARRA YS AND ARRA YLISTS 341\\nArrayList<CurveData> curves = new ArrayList<CurveData>();\\nHere we have a list of objects, where each object contains a li st of points as part of its data!\\nLet’s look at a few examples of processing this data structur e. When the user clicks the mouse\\non the drawing surface, it’s the start of a new curve, and a new CurveData object must be\\ncreated and added to the list of curves. The instance variabl es in the new CurveData object\\nmust also be initialized. Here is the code from the mousePressed() routine that does this:\\ncurrentCurve = new CurveData(); // Create a new CurveData ob ject.\\ncurrentCurve.color = currentColor; // The color of the curv e is taken from an\\n// instance variable that represents the\\n// currently selected drawing color.\\ncurrentCurve.symmetric = useSymmetry; // The \"symmetric\" property of the curve\\n// is also copied from the current value\\n// of an instance variable, useSymmetry.\\ncurrentCurve.points = new ArrayList<Point>(); // Create a new point list object.\\ncurrentCurve.points.add( new Point(evt.getX(), evt.getY()) );\\n// The point where the user pressed the mouse is the first point on\\n// the curve. A new Point object is created to hold the coordin ates\\n// of that point and is added to the list of points for the curve.\\ncurves.add(currentCurve); // Add the CurveData object to t he list of curves.\\nAs the user drags the mouse, new points are added to currentCurve, and repaint() is called.\\nWhen the picture is redrawn, the new point will be part of the p icture.\\nThe paintComponent() method has to use the data in curves to draw all the curves. The\\nbasic structure is a for-each loop that processes the data fo r each individual curve in turn. This\\nhas the form:\\nfor ( CurveData curve : curves ) {\\n.\\n. // Draw the curve represented by the object, curve, of type C urveData.\\n.\\n}\\nIn the body of this loop, curve.points is a variable of type ArrayList<Point> that holds the\\nlist of points on the curve. The i-th point on the curve can be obtained by calling the get()\\nmethod of this list: curve.points.get(i). This returns a value of type Point which contains\\ninstance variables named x and y. W e can refer directly to the x-coordinate of the i-th point\\nas:\\ncurve.points.get(i).x\\nThis might seem rather complicated, but it’s a nice example o f a complex name that speciﬁes\\na path to a desired piece of data: Go to the object, curve. Inside curve, go to points. Inside\\npoints, get the i-th item. And from that item, get the instance variable named x. Here is the\\ncomplete deﬁnition of the paintCompontent() method:\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\\nsuper.paintComponent(g);\\nfor ( CurveData curve : curves) {\\ng.setColor(curve.color);\\nfor (int i = 1; i < curve.points.size(); i++) {'),\n",

In addition to serving as\\nan example of using parameterized types, it also serves an an other example of creating and\\nusing menus.\\n7.3.5 Vectors\\nThe ArrayList class was introduced in Java version 1.2, as one of a group of c lasses designed\\nfor working with collections of objects. W e’ll look at these “collection classes” in Chapter 10.\\nEarly versions of Java did not include ArrayList, but they did have a very similar class named\\njava.util.Vector. Y ou can still see Vectors used in older code and in many of Java’s standard\\nclasses, so it’s worth knowing about them. Using a Vector is similar to using an ArrayList, except\\nthat diﬀerent names are used for some commonly used instance methods, and some instance\\nmethods in one class don’t correspond to any instance method in the other class.\\nLike an ArrayList, a Vector is similar to an array of Objects that can grow to be as large as\\nnecessary . The default constructor, new Vector(), creates a vector with no elements. Suppose\\nthat vec is a Vector. Then we have:\\n• vec.size() — a function that returns the number of elements currently in the vector.\\n• vec.elementAt(N) — returns the N-th element of the vector, for an integer N. N must be\\nin the range 0 to vec.size()-1. This is the same as get(N) for an ArrayList.\\n• vec.setElementAt(obj,N) — sets the N-th element in the vector to be obj. N must be\\nin the range 0 to vec.size()-1. This is the same as set(N,obj) for an ArrayList.\\n• vec.addElement(obj) — adds the Object, obj, to the end of the vector. This is the same\\nas the add() method of an ArrayList.\\n• vec.removeElement(obj) — removes obj from the vector, if it occurs. Only the ﬁrst\\noccurrence is removed. This is the same as remove(obj) for an ArrayList.\\n• vec.removeElementAt(N) — removes the N-th element, for an integer N. N must be in\\nthe range 0 to vec.size()-1. This is the same as remove(N) for an ArrayList.\\n• vec.setSize(N) — sets the size of the vector to N. If there were more than N elements in\\nvec, the extra elements are removed. If there were fewer than N elements, extra spaces are\\nﬁlled with null. The ArrayList class, unfortunately , does not have a setSize() method.'),\n",

SEARCHING AND SOR TING 343\\nThe Vector class includes many more methods, but these are probably the most commonly\\nused. Note that in Java 5.0, Vector can be used as a paramaterized type in exactly the same\\nway as ArrayList. That is, if BaseT ype is any class or interface name, then Vector<BaseT ype>\\nrepresents vectors that can hold only objects of type BaseT ype.\\n7.4 Searching and Sorting\\nTwo array processing techniquesthat are particularly common are searching and sort-\\ning. Searching here refers to ﬁnding an item in the array that mee ts some speciﬁed criterion.\\nSorting refers to rearranging all the items in the array into increasing or decreasing order (where\\nthe meaning of increasing and decreasing can depend on the co ntext).\\nSorting and searching are often discussed, in a theoretical sort of way , using an array of\\nnumbers as an example. In practical situations, though, mor e interesting types of data are\\nusually involved. F or example, the array might be a mailing l ist, and each element of the array\\nmight be an object containing a name and address. Given the na me of a person, you might\\nwant to look up that person’s address. This is an example of se arching, since you want to ﬁnd\\nthe object in the array that contains the given name. It would also be useful to be able to sort\\nthe array according to various criteria. One example of sort ing would be ordering the elements\\nof the array so that the names are in alphabetical order. Anot her example would be to order\\nthe elements of the array according to zip code before printi ng a set of mailing labels. (This\\nkind of sorting can get you a cheaper postage rate on a large ma iling.)\\nThis example can be generalized to a more abstract situation in which we have an array\\nthat contains objects, and we want to search or sort the array based on the value of one of the\\ninstance variables in that array . W e can use some terminolog y here that originated in work\\nwith “databases,” which are just large, organized collecti ons of data. W e refer to each of the\\nobjects in the array as a record. The instance variables in an object are then called ﬁelds of\\nthe record. In the mailing list example, each record would co ntain a name and address. The\\nﬁelds of the record might be the ﬁrst name, last name, street a ddress, state, city and zip code.\\nF or the purpose of searching or sorting, one of the ﬁelds is de signated to be the key ﬁeld.\\nSearching then means ﬁnding a record in the array that has a sp eciﬁed value in its key ﬁeld.\\nSorting means moving the records around in the array so that t he key ﬁelds of the record are\\nin increasing (or decreasing) order.\\nIn this section, most of my examples follow the tradition of u sing arrays of numbers. But\\nI’ll also give a few examples using records and keys, to remin d you of the more practical\\napplications.\\n7.4.1 Searching\\nThere is an obvious algorithm for searching for a particular item in an array: Look at each\\nitem in the array in turn, and check whether that item is the on e you are looking for. If so,\\nthe search is ﬁnished. If you look at every item without ﬁndin g the one you want, then you\\ncan be sure that the item is not in the array . It’s easy to write a subroutine to implement this\\nalgorithm. Let’s say the array that you want to search is an ar ray of ints. Here is a method\\nthat will search the array for a speciﬁed integer. If the inte ger is found, the method returns\\nthe index of the location in the array where it is found. If the integer is not in the array , the\\nmethod returns the value -1 as a signal that the integer could not be found:\\n/**'),\n",

ARRA YS\\n* Searches the array A for the integer N. If N is not in the array ,\\n* then -1 is returned. If N is in the array, then return value is\\n* the first integer i that satisfies A[i] == N.\\n*/\\nstatic int find(int[] A, int N) {\\nfor (int index = 0; index < A.length; index++) {\\nif ( A[index] == N )\\nreturn index; // N has been found at this index!\\n}\\n// If we get this far, then N has not been found\\n// anywhere in the array. Return a value of -1.\\nreturn -1;\\n}\\nThis method of searching an array by looking at each item in tu rn is called linear search .\\nIf nothing is known about the order of the items in the array , t hen there is really no better\\nalternative algorithm. But if the elements in the array are k nown to be in increasing or decreas-\\ning order, then a much faster search algorithm can be used. An array in which the elements are\\nin order is said to be sorted. Of course, it takes some work to sort an array , but if the arra y\\nis to be searched many times, then the work done in sorting it c an really pay oﬀ.\\nBinary search is a method for searching for a given item in a sorted array . Although\\nthe implementation is not trivial, the basic idea is simple: If you are searching for an item in\\na sorted list, then it is possible to eliminate half of the ite ms in the list by inspecting a single\\nitem. F or example, suppose that you are looking for the numbe r 42 in a sorted array of 1000\\nintegers. Let’s assume that the array is sorted into increas ing order. Suppose you check item\\nnumber 500 in the array , and ﬁnd that the item is 93. Since 42 is less than 93, and since the\\nelements in the array are in increasing order, we can conclud e that if 42 occurs in the array\\nat all, then it must occur somewhere before location 500. All the locations numbered 500 or\\nabove contain values that are greater than or equal to 93. The se locations can be eliminated\\nas possible locations of the number 42.\\nThe next obvious step is to check location 250. If the number a t that location is, say , -21,\\nthen you can eliminate locations before 250 and limit furthe r search to locations between 251\\nand 499. The next test will limit the search to about 125 locat ions, and the one after that to\\nabout 62. After just 10 steps, there is only one location left . This is a whole lot better than\\nlooking through every element in the array . If there were a mi llion items, it would still take\\nonly 20 steps for binary search to search the array! (Mathema tically , the number of steps is\\napproximately equal to the logarithm, in the base 2, of the nu mber of items in the array .)\\nIn order to make binary search into a Java subroutine that sea rches an array A for an item\\nN, we just have to keep track of the range of locations that coul d possibly contain N. At each\\nstep, as we eliminate possibilities, we reduce the size of th is range. The basic operation is to\\nlook at the item in the middle of the range. If this item is grea ter than N, then the second\\nhalf of the range can be eliminated. If it is less than N, then the ﬁrst half of the range can\\nbe eliminated. If the number in the middle just happens to be N exactly , then the search is\\nﬁnished. If the size of the range decreases to zero, then the n umber N does not occur in the\\narray . Here is a subroutine that returns the location of N in a sorted array A. If N cannot be\\nfound in the array , then a value of -1 is returned instead:\\n/**'),\n",

The standard\\nexample of an association list is a dictionary . A dictionary associates deﬁnitions with words.\\nGiven a word, you can use the dictionary to look up its deﬁniti on. W e can think of the dictionary\\nas being a list of pairs of the form (w,d), where w is a word and d is its deﬁnition. A general\\nassociation list is a list of pairs (k,v), where k is some “key” value, and v is a value associated\\nto that key . In general, we want to assume that no two pairs in t he list have the same key .\\nThere are two basic operations on association lists: Given a key , k, ﬁnd the value v associated\\nwith k, if any . And given a key , k, and a value v, add the pair (k,v) to the association list\\n(replacing the pair, if any , that had the same key value). The two operations are usually called\\nget and put.\\nAssociation lists are very widely used in computer science. F or example, a compiler has\\nto keep track of the location in memory associated with each v ariable. It can do this with an\\nassociation list in which each key is a variable name and the a ssociated value is the address of\\nthat variable in memory . Another example would be a mailing l ist, if we think of it as associating\\nan address to each name on the list. As a related example, cons ider a phone directory that'),\n",

Th ere are many algorithms available\\nfor doing so. One of the easiest to understand is the insertion sort algorithm. This method\\nis also applicable to the problem of keeping a list in sorted order as you add new items to the\\nlist. Let’s consider that case ﬁrst:\\nSuppose you have a sorted list and you want to add an item to tha t list. If you want to\\nmake sure that the modiﬁed list is still sorted, then the item must be inserted into the right\\nlocation, with all the smaller items coming before it and all the bigger items after it. This will\\nmean moving each of the bigger items up one space to make room f or the new item.\\n/*\\n* Precondition: itemsInArray is the number of items that are\\n* stored in A.

There are more complicated sorting alg orithms that are much faster than\\ninsertion sort and selection sort for large arrays. I’ll dis cuss one such algorithm in Chapter 9.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nA variation of selection sort is used in the Hand class that was introduced in Subsection 5.4.1.\\n(By the way , you are ﬁnally in a position to fully understand t he source code for both the Hand\\nclass and the Deck class from that section. See the source ﬁles Deck.java and Hand.java.)\\nIn the Hand class, a hand of playing cards is represented by a Vector. This is older code,\\nwhich used Vector instead of ArrayList, and I have chosen not to modify it so that you would\\nsee at least one example of using Vectors. See Subsection 7.3.5 for a discussion of Vectors.\\nThe objects stored in the Vector are of type Card. A Card object contains instance methods\\ngetSuit() and getValue() that can be used to determine the suit and value of the card. In\\nmy sorting method, I actually create a new vector and move the cards one-by-one from the old\\nvector to the new vector. The cards are selected from the old v ector in increasing order. In the\\nend, the new vector becomes the hand and the old vector is disc arded. This is certainly not\\nthe most eﬃcient procedure! But hands of cards are so small th at the ineﬃciency is negligible.\\nHere is the code for sorting cards by suit:\\n/**\\n* Sorts the cards in the hand so that cards of the same suit are\\n* grouped together, and within a suit the cards are sorted by value.\\n* Note that aces are considered to have the lowest value, 1.\\n*/\\npublic void sortBySuit() {\\nVector newHand = new Vector();\\nwhile (hand.size() > 0) {'),\n",

In this case, we consider one card to be less than another if the suit\\nof the ﬁrst card is less than the suit of the second, and also if the suits are the same and the\\nvalue of the second card is less than the value of the ﬁrst. The second part of this test ensures\\nthat cards with the same suit will end up sorted by value.\\nSorting a list of Strings raises a similar problem: the “ <” operator is not deﬁned for strings.\\nHowever, the String class does deﬁne a compareTo method. If str1 and str2 are of type String,\\nthen\\nstr1.compareTo(str2)\\nreturns an int that is 0 when str1 is equal to str2, is less than 0 when str1 preceeds str2,\\nand is greater than 0 when str1 follows str2. The deﬁnition of “succeeds” and “follows” for\\nstrings uses what is called lexicographic ordering , which is based on the Unicode values of\\nthe characters in the strings. Lexicographic ordering is no t the same as alphabetical ordering,\\neven for strings that consist entirely of letters (because i n lexicographic ordering, all the upper\\ncase letters come before all the lower case letters). Howeve r, for words consisting strictly of\\nthe 26 lower case letters in the English alphabet, lexicogra phic and alphabetic ordering are the\\nsame. Thus, if str1 and str2 are strings containing only letters from the English alphab et,\\nthen the test\\nstr1.toLowerCase().compareTo(str2.toLowerCase()) < 0\\nis true if and only if str1 comes before str2 in alphabetical order.\\n7.4.5 Unsorting\\nI can’t resist ending this section on sorting with a related p roblem that is much less common,\\nbut is a bit more fun. That is the problem of putting the elemen ts of an array into a random\\norder. The typical case of this problem is shuﬄing a deck of ca rds. A good algorithm for\\nshuﬄing is similar to selection sort, except that instead of moving the biggest item to the end\\nof the list, an item is selected at random and moved to the end o f the list. Here is a subroutine\\nto shuﬄe an array of ints:\\n/**\\n* Postcondition: The items in A have been rearranged into a ra ndom order.\\n*/\\nstatic void shuffle(int[] A) {'),\n",

Y ou can have an array of ints, an\\narray of Strings, an array of Objects, and so on. In particular, since an array type is a ﬁrst-class\\nJava type, you can have an array of arrays. F or example, an arr ay of ints has type int[ ]. This\\nmeans that there is automatically another type, int[ ][ ], which represents an “array of arrays of\\nints”. Such an array is said to be a two-dimensional array . Of course once you have the\\ntype int[ ][ ], there is nothing to stop you from forming the type int[ ][ ][ ], which represents a\\nthree-dimensional array —and so on. There is no limit on the number of dimensions that a n\\narray type can have. However, arrays of dimension three or hi gher are fairly uncommon, and\\nI concentrate here mainly on two-dimensional arrays. The ty pe BaseT ype[ ][ ]is usually read\\n“two-dimensional array of BaseT ype” or “ BaseT ype array array”.\\n7.5.1 Creating Two-dimensional Arrays\\nThe declaration statement “ int[][] A;” declares a variable named A of type int[ ][ ]. This\\nvariable can hold a reference to an object of type int[ ][ ]. The assignment statement “ A = new\\nint[3][4];” creates a new two-dimensional array object and sets A to point to the newly cre-\\nated object. As usual, the declaration and assignment could be combined in a single declaration\\nstatement “ int[][] A = new int[3][4];”. The newly created object is an array of arrays-\\nof-ints. The notation int[3][4] indicates that there are 3 arrays-of- ints in the array A, and\\nthat there are 4 ints in each array-of- ints. However, trying to think in such terms can get a bit\\nconfusing—as you might have already noticed. So it is custom ary to think of a two-dimensional\\narray of items as a rectangular grid or matrix of items. The notation “ new int[3][4]” can\\nthen be taken to describe a grid of ints with 3 rows and 4 columns. The following picture\\nmight help:'),\n",

These arrays can be referred to as A[0], A[1], and A[2]. Each row is in fact a value of\\ntype int[ ]. It could, for example, be passed to a subroutine that asks fo r a parameter of type\\nint[ ].\\nThe notation A[1] refers to one of the rows of the array A. Since A[1] is itself an array of\\nints, you can use another subscript to refer to one of the position s in that row. F or example,\\nA[1][3] refers to item number 3 in row number 1. Keep in mind, of course , that both rows\\nand columns are numbered starting from zero. So, in the above example, A[1][3] is 5. More\\ngenerally , A[i][j] refers to the grid position in row number i and column number j. The 12\\nitems in A are named as follows:\\nA[0][0] A[0][1] A[0][2] A[0][3]\\nA[1][0] A[1][1] A[1][2] A[1][3]\\nA[2][0] A[2][1] A[2][2] A[2][3]\\nA[i][j] is actually a variable of type int. Y ou can assign integer values to it or use it in any\\nother context where an integer variable is allowed.\\nIt might be worth noting that A.length gives the number of rows of A. T o get the number\\nof columns in A, you have to ask how many ints there are in a row; this number would be\\ngiven by A[0].length, or equivalently by A[1].length or A[2].length. (There is actually\\nno rule that says that all the rows of an array must have the sam e length, and some advanced\\napplications of arrays use varying-sized rows. But if you us e the new operator to create an array\\nin the manner described above, you’ll always get an array wit h equal-sized rows.)\\nThree-dimensional arrays are treated similarly . F or examp le, a three-dimensional array of\\nints could be created with the declaration statement “ int[][][] B = new int[7][5][11];”.\\nIt’s possible to visualize the value of B as a solid 7-by-5-by-11 block of cells. Each cell holds an\\nint and represents one position in the three-dimensional array . Individual positions in the array\\ncan be referred to with variable names of the form B[i][j][k]. Higher-dimensional arrays'),\n",

ARRA YS\\nfollow the same pattern, although for dimensions greater th an three, there is no easy way to\\nvisualize the structure of the array .\\nIt’s possible to ﬁll a multi-dimensional array with speciﬁe d items at the time it is declared.\\nRecall that when an ordinary one-dimensional array variabl e is declared, it can be assigned\\nan “array initializer,” which is just a list of values enclos ed between braces, { and }. Array\\ninitializers can also be used when a multi-dimensional arra y is declared. An initializer for a\\ntwo-dimensional array consists of a list of one-dimensiona l array initializers, one for each row\\nin the two-dimensional array . F or example, the array A shown in the picture above could be\\ncreated with:\\nint[][] A = { { 1, 0, 12, -1 },\\n{ 7, -3, 2, 5 },\\n{ -5, -2, 2, -9 }\\n};\\nIf no initializer is provided for an array , then when the arra y is created it is automatically ﬁlled\\nwith the appropriate value: zero for numbers, false for boolean, and null for objects.\\n7.5.2 Using Two-dimensional Arrays\\nJust as in the case of one-dimensional arrays, two-dimensio nal arrays are often processed using\\nfor statements. T o process all the items in a two-dimensional ar ray , you have to use one for\\nstatement nested inside another. If the array A is declared as\\nint[][] A = new int[3][4];\\nthen you could store a zero into each location in A with:\\nfor (int row = 0; row < 3; row++) {\\nfor (int column = 0; column < 4; column++) {\\nA[row][column] = 0;\\n}\\n}\\nThe ﬁrst time the outer for loop executes (with row = 0), the inner for loop ﬁlls in the four\\nvalues in the ﬁrst row of A, namely A[0][0] = 0, A[0][1] = 0, A[0][2] = 0, and A[0][3]\\n= 0. The next execution of the outer for loop ﬁlls in the second row of A. And the third and\\nﬁnal execution of the outer loop ﬁlls in the ﬁnal row of A.\\nSimilarly , you could add up all the items in A with:\\nint sum = 0;\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)\\nfor (int j = 0; j < 4; j++)\\nsum = sum + A[i][j];\\nThis could even be done with nested for-each loops. Keep in mi nd that the elements in A are\\nobjects of type int[ ], while the elements in each row of A are of type int:\\nint sum = 0;\\nfor ( int[] row : A ) { // For each row in A...\\nfor ( int item : row ) // For each item in that row...\\nsum = sum + item; // Add item to the sum.\\n}'),\n",

Often, the gr id is built into the problem.\\nF or example, a chess board is a grid with 8 rows and 8 columns. I f a class named ChessPiece\\nis available to represent individual chess pieces, then the contents of a chess board could be\\nrepresented by a two-dimensional array:\\nChessPiece[][] board = new ChessPiece[8][8];\\nOr consider the “mosaic” of colored rectangles used in an exa mple in Subsection 4.6.2. The\\nmosaic is implemented by a class named MosaicCanvas.java. The data about the color of each\\nof the rectangles in the mosaic is stored in an instance varia ble named grid of type Color[ ][ ].\\nEach position in this grid is occupied by a value of type Color. There is one position in the grid\\nfor each colored rectangle in the mosaic. The actual two-dim ensional array is created by the\\nstatement:\\ngrid = new Color[ROWS][COLUMNS];\\nwhere ROWS is the number of rows of rectangles in the mosaic and COLUMNS is the number of\\ncolumns. The value of the Color variable grid[i][j] is the color of the rectangle in row number\\ni and column number j. When the color of that rectangle is changed to some color, c, the value\\nstored in grid[i][j] is changed with a statement of the form “ grid[i][j] = c;”. When the\\nmosaic is redrawn, the values stored in the two-dimensional array are used to decide what color\\nto make each rectangle. Here is a simpliﬁed version of the cod e from the MosaicCanvas class\\nthat draws all the colored rectangles in the grid. Y ou can see how it uses the array:\\nint rowHeight = getHeight() / ROWS;\\nint colWidth = getWidth() / COLUMNS;\\nfor (int row = 0; row < ROWS; row++) {\\nfor (int col = 0; col < COLUMNS; col++) {\\ng.setColor( grid[row][col] ); // Get color from array.\\ng.fillRect( col*colWidth, row*rowHeight,\\ncolWidth, rowHeight );\\n}\\n}\\nSometimes two-dimensional arrays are used in problems in wh ich the grid is not so visually\\nobvious. Consider a company that owns 25 stores. Suppose tha t the company has data about\\nthe proﬁt earned at each store for each month in the year 2006. If the stores are numbered\\nfrom 0 to 24, and if the twelve months from January ’06 through December ’06 are numbered\\nfrom 0 to 11, then the proﬁt data could be stored in an array , profit, constructed as follows:\\ndouble[][] profit = new double[25][12];\\nprofit[3][2] would be the amount of proﬁt earned at store number 3 in March, and\\nmore generally , profit[storeNum][monthNum] would be the amount of proﬁt earned in store\\nnumber storeNum in month number monthNum. In this example, the one-dimensional array\\nprofit[storeNum] has a very useful meaning: It is just the proﬁt data for one par ticular store\\nfor the whole year.\\nLet’s assume that the profit array has already been ﬁlled with data. This data can be\\nprocessed in a lot of interesting ways. F or example, the tota l proﬁt for the company—for the\\nwhole year from all its stores—can be calculated by adding up all the entries in the array:'),\n",

It is mainly this class that I want to ta lk about.\\nThe CheckersData class has an instance variable named board of type int[][]. The value\\nof board is set to “ new int[8][8]”, an 8-by-8 grid of integers. The values stored in the grid\\nare deﬁned as constants representing the possible contents of a square on a checkerboard:\\nstatic final int\\nEMPTY = 0, // Value representing an empty square.\\nRED = 1, // A regular red piece.\\nRED\\nKING = 2, // A red king.\\nBLACK = 3, // A regular black piece.\\nBLACK\\nKING = 4; // A black king.\\nThe constants RED and BLACK are also used in my program (or, perhaps, misused) to represe nt\\nthe two players in the game. When a game is started, the values in the variable, board, are set\\nto represent the initial state of the board. The grid of value s looks like\\nB L A C K E M P T Y B L A C K E M P T Y B L A C K E M P T Y B L A C K E M P T Y\\n0\\nB L A C KE M P T Y B L A C K E M P T Y B L A C K E M P T Y B L A C K E M P T Y\\n1\\nB L A C K E M P T Y B L A C K E M P T Y B L A C K E M P T Y B L A C K E M P T Y\\n2\\nE M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y\\n3\\nE M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y\\nE M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y\\n4\\nE M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y\\n5 R\\nE D\\n6 R\\nE D E M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y\\n7\\nR\\nE D\\nR\\nE D\\nR\\nE D\\nE M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y\\nR\\nE D\\nR\\nE D\\nR\\nE D\\n0 1\\n2 3\\n4\\n5 6\\n7\\nR\\nE DE M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y E M P T Y\\nR\\nE D\\nR\\nE D\\nR\\nE D\\nA black piece can only move “down” the grid. That is, the row nu mber of the square it\\nmoves to must be greater than the row number of the square it co mes from. A red piece can\\nonly move up the grid. Kings of either color, of course, can mo ve in both directions.\\nOne function of the CheckersData class is to take care of all the details of making moves\\non the board. An instance method named makeMove() is provided to do this. When a player\\nmoves a piece from one square to another, the values stored at two positions in the array are\\nchanged. But that’s not all. If the move is a jump, then the pie ce that was jumped is removed\\nfrom the board. (The method checks whether the move is a jump b y checking if the square to\\nwhich the piece is moving is two rows away from the square wher e it starts.) F urthermore, a\\nRED piece that moves to row 0 or a BLACK piece that moves to row 7 becomes a king. This is\\ngood programming: the rest of the program doesn’t have to wor ry about any of these details.\\nIt just calls this makeMove() method:\\n/**\\n* Make the move from (fromRow,fromCol) to (toRow,toCol). It is\\n* ASSUMED that this move is legal! If the move is a jump, the\\n* jumped piece is removed from the board. If a piece moves\\n* to the last row on the opponent’s side of the board, the\\n* piece becomes a king.\\n*/\\nvoid makeMove(int fromRow, int fromCol, int toRow, int toCol) {'),\n",

Here are some related questions:\\n• How many random people do you have to select before you ﬁnd three people who\\nshare the same birthday? (That is, all three people were born on the same day in\\nthe same month, but not necessarily in the same year.)\\n• Suppose you choose 365 people at random.

(The number could theoretically be anywhere from 1 to 3 65).\\n• How many diﬀerent people do you have to check before you’ve fo und at least one\\nperson with a birthday on each of the 365 days of the year?\\nW rite three programs to answer these questions. Each of your programs sh ould sim-\\nulate choosing people at random and checking their birthday s. (In each case, ignore the\\npossibility of leap years.)\\n2.

The Graph-\\nics class includes commands for drawing and ﬁlling polygons. F o r these commands, the\\ncoordinates of the vertices of the polygon are stored in arra ys.

It is restricted to moving in a rectangle in the (x,y) plane.\\nIt will “bounce back” when it hits one of the sides of this rect angle. A MovingBall does not\\nactually move by itself. It’s just a collection of data. Y ou h ave to call instance methods to\\ntell it to update its position and to draw itself. The constru ctor for the MovingBall class\\ntakes the form\\nnew MovingBall(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\\nwhere the parameters are integers that specify the limits on the x and y coordinates of\\nthe ball. In this exercise, you will want balls to bounce oﬀ th e sides of the applet, so you\\nwill create them with the constructor call\\nnew MovingBall(0, getWidth(), 0, getHeight())\\nThe constructor creates a ball that initially is colored red , has a radius of 5 pixels, is\\nlocated at the center of its range, has a random speed between 4 and 12, and is headed in\\na random direction. There is one problem here: Y ou can’t use this constructor until the\\nwidth and height of the component are known. It would be OK to u se it in the init()\\nmethod of an applet, but not in the constructor of an applet or panel class. If you are using\\na panel class to display the ball, one slightly messy solutio n is to create the MovingBall\\nobjects in the panel’s paintComponent() method the ﬁrst time that method is called. Y ou\\ncan be sure that the size of the panel has been determined befo re paintComponent() is\\ncalled. This is what I did in my own solution to this exercise.'),\n",

ARRA YS\\nIf ball is a variable of type MovingBall, then the following methods are available:\\n• ball.draw(g) — draw the ball in a graphics context. The parameter, g, must be of\\ntype Graphics. (The drawing color in g will be changed to the color of the ball.)\\n• ball.travel() — change the (x,y)-coordinates of the ball by an amount equal to\\nits speed. The ball has a certain direction of motion, and the ball is moved in that\\ndirection. Ordinarily , you will call this once for each fram e of an animation, so the\\nspeed is given in terms of “pixels per frame”. Calling this ro utine does not move\\nthe ball on the screen. It just changes the values of some inst ance variables in the\\nobject. The next time the object’s draw() method is called, the ball will be drawn\\nin the new position.\\n• ball.headTowards(x,y) — change the direction of motion of the ball so that it is\\nheaded towards the point (x,y). This does not aﬀect the speed.\\nThese are the methods that you will need for this exercise. Th ere are also methods for\\nsetting various properties of the ball, such as ball.setColor(color) for changing the\\ncolor and ball.setRadius(radius) for changing its size. See the source code for more\\ninformation.\\nF or this exercise, you should create an applet that shows an a nimation of balls bouncing\\naround on a black background. Use a Timer to drive the animation. (See Subsection 6.5.1.)\\nUse an array of type MovingBall[] to hold the data for the balls. In addition, your\\nprogram should listen for mouse and mouse motion events. Whe n the user presses the\\nmouse or drags the mouse, call each of the ball’s headTowards() methods to make the\\nballs head towards the mouse’s location. My solution uses 50 balls and a time delay of 50\\nmilliseconds for the timer.\\n5. The sample program RandomArtPanel.java from Subsection 6.5.1 shows a diﬀerent ran-\\ndom “artwork” every four seconds. There are three types of “a rt”, one made from lines,\\none from circles, and one from ﬁlled squares. However, the pr ogram does not save the data\\nfor the picture that is shown on the screen. As a result, the pi cture cannot be redrawn\\nwhen necessary .

The superclass also contains a draw() method that draws the\\npicture; this is an abstract method because its implementat ion depends on the particular\\ntype of art that is being drawn. The abstract class can be deﬁn ed as:\\nprivate abstract class ArtData {\\nColor backgroundColor; // The background color for the art.\\nArtData() { // Constructor sets background color to be a rand om gray.\\nint x = (int)(256*Math.random());\\nbackgroundColor = new Color( x, x, x, );\\n}\\nabstract void draw(Graphics g); // Draws this artwork.\\n}'),\n",

The game of Go Moku (also known as Pente or Five Stones) is simi lar to Tic-T ac-T oe,\\nexcept that it played on a much larger board and the object is t o get ﬁve squares in a row\\nrather than three. Players take turns placing pieces on a boa rd. A piece can be placed\\nin any empty square. The ﬁrst player to get ﬁve pieces in a row— horizontally , vertically ,\\nor diagonally—wins. If all squares are ﬁlled before either p layer wins, then the game is a\\ndraw.

W hen computers are given more\\nimportant tasks, the consequences of failure can be proport ionately more serious.\\nJust a few years ago, the failure of two multi-million space m issions to Mars was prominent\\nin the news. Both failures were probably due to software prob lems, but in both cases the\\nproblem was not with an incorrect program as such. In Septemb er 1999, the Mars Climate\\nOrbiter burned up in the Martian atmosphere because data tha t was expressed in English units\\nof measurement (such as feet and pounds) was entered into a co mputer program that was\\ndesigned to use metric units (such as centimeters and grams) . A few months later, the Mars\\nPolar Lander probably crashed because its software turned o ﬀ its landing engines too soon.\\nThe program was supposed to detect the bump when the spacecra ft landed and turn oﬀ the\\nengines then. It has been determined that deployment of the l anding gear might have jarred\\nthe spacecraft enough to activate the program, causing it to turn oﬀ the engines when the\\nspacecraft was still in the air. The unpowered spacecraft wo uld then have fallen to the Martian\\nsurface. A more robust system would have checked the altitud e before turning oﬀ the engines!\\nThere are many equally dramatic stories of problems caused b y incorrect or poorly written\\nsoftware.

INTRODUCTION TO CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS 375\\n8.1.2 Java to the Rescue\\nPart of the problem, according to the inventors of Java, can b e traced to programming languages\\nthemselves. Java was designed to provide some protection ag ainst certain types of errors. How\\ncan a language feature help prevent errors? Let’s look at a fe w examples.\\nEarly programming languages did not require variables to be declared. In such languages,\\nwhen a variable name is used in a program, the variable is crea ted automatically . Y ou might\\nconsider this more convenient than having to declare every v ariable explicitly . But there is an\\nunfortunate consequence: An inadvertent spelling error mi ght introduce an extra variable that\\nyou had no intention of creating. This type of error was respo nsible, according to one famous\\nstory , for yet another lost spacecraft. In the FORTRAN programming language, the command “ DO\\n20 I = 1,5” is the ﬁrst statement of a counting loop. Now, spaces are ins igniﬁcant in FORTRAN,\\nso this is equivalent to “ DO20I=1,5”. On the other hand, the command “ DO20I=1.5”, with a\\nperiod instead of a comma, is an assignment statement that as signs the value 1.5 to the variable\\nDO20I. Supposedly , the inadvertent substitution of a period for a comma in a statement of this\\ntype caused a rocket to blow up on take-oﬀ. Because FORTRAN doesn’t require variables to be\\ndeclared, the compiler would be happy to accept the statemen t “ DO20I=1.5.” It would just\\ncreate a new variable named DO20I. If FORTRAN required variables to be declared, the compiler\\nwould have complained that the variable DO20I was undeclared.\\nWhile most programming languages today do require variable s to be declared, there are\\nother features in common programming languages that can cau se problems. Java has eliminated\\nsome of these features. Some people complain that this makes Java less eﬃcient and less\\npowerful. While there is some justice in this criticism, the increase in security and robustness is\\nprobably worth the cost in most circumstances. The best defe nse against some types of errors\\nis to design a programming language in which the errors are im possible. In other cases, where\\nthe error can’t be completely eliminated, the language can b e designed so that when the error\\ndoes occur, it will automatically be detected. This will at l east prevent the error from causing\\nfurther harm, and it will alert the programmer that there is a bug that needs ﬁxing. Let’s look\\nat a few cases where the designers of Java have taken these app roaches.\\nAn array is created with a certain number of locations, numbe red from zero up to some\\nspeciﬁed maximum index. It is an error to try to use an array lo cation that is outside of the\\nspeciﬁed range. In Java, any attempt to do so is detected auto matically by the system. In some\\nother languages, such as C and C++, it’s up to the programmer t o make sure that the index\\nis within the legal range. Suppose that an array , A, has three locations, A[0], A[1], and A[2].\\nThen A[3], A[4], and so on refer to memory locations beyond the end of the arra y . In Java,\\nan attempt to store data in A[3] will be detected. The program will be terminated (unless the\\nerror is “caught”, as discussed in Section 3.7). In C or C++, t he computer will just go ahead\\nand store the data in memory that is not part of the array . Sinc e there is no telling what that\\nmemory location is being used for, the result will be unpredi ctable. The consequences could\\nbe much more serious than a terminated program. (See, for exa mple, the discussion of buﬀer\\noverﬂow errors later in this section.)\\nPointers are a notorious source of programming errors. In Ja va, a variable of object type\\nholds either a pointer to an object or the special value null. Any attempt to use a null value as\\nif it were a pointer to an actual object will be detected by the system. In some other languages,\\nagain, it’s up to the programmer to avoid such null pointer er rors. In my old Macintosh\\ncomputer, a null pointer was actually implemented as if it were a pointer to me mory location\\nzero. A program could use a null pointer to change values stor ed in memory near location zero.\\nUnfortunately , the Macintosh stored important system data in those locations. Changing that'),\n",

CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS\\ndata could cause the whole system to crash, a consequence mor e severe than a single failed\\nprogram.\\nAnother type of pointer error occurs when a pointer value is p ointing to an object of the\\nwrong type or to a segment of memory that does not even hold a va lid object at all. These\\ntypes of errors are impossible in Java, which does not allow p rogrammers to manipulate pointers\\ndirectly . In other languages, it is possible to set a pointer to point, essentially , to any location\\nin memory . If this is done incorrectly , then using the pointe r can have unpredictable results.\\nAnother type of error that cannot occur in Java is a memory lea k. In Java, once there are\\nno longer any pointers that refer to an object, that object is “garbage collected” so that the\\nmemory that it occupied can be reused. In other languages, it is the programmer’s responsibility\\nto return unused memory to the system. If the programmer fail s to do this, unused memory\\ncan build up, leaving less memory for programs and data. Ther e is a story that many common\\nprograms for older Windows computers had so many memory leak s that the computer would\\nrun out of memory after a few days of use and would have to be res tarted.\\nMany programs have been found to suﬀer from buﬀer overﬂow errors . Buﬀer overﬂow\\nerrors often make the news because they are responsible for m any network security problems.\\nWhen one computer receives data from another computer over a network, that data is stored in\\na buﬀer. The buﬀer is just a segment of memory that has been all ocated by a program to hold\\ndata that it expects to receive. A buﬀer overﬂow occurs when m ore data is received than will\\nﬁt in the buﬀer. The question is, what happens then? If the err or is detected by the program\\nor by the networking software, then the only thing that has ha ppened is a failed network\\ndata transmission. The real problem occurs when the softwar e does not properly detect buﬀer\\noverﬂows. In that case, the software continues to store data in memory even after the buﬀer is\\nﬁlled, and the extra data goes into some part of memory that wa s not allocated by the program\\nas part of the buﬀer. That memory might be in use for some other purpose. It might contain\\nimportant data. It might even contain part of the program its elf. This is where the real security\\nissues come in. Suppose that a buﬀer overﬂow causes part of a p rogram to be replaced with\\nextra data received over a network. When the computer goes to execute the part of the program\\nthat was replaced, it’s actually executing data that was rec eived from another computer. That\\ndata could be anything. It could be a program that crashes the computer or takes it over. A\\nmalicious programmer who ﬁnds a convenient buﬀer overﬂow er ror in networking software can\\ntry to exploit that error to trick other computers into execu ting his programs.\\nF or software written completely in Java, buﬀer overﬂow erro rs are impossible. The language\\nsimply does not provide any way to store data into memory that has not been properly allocated.\\nT o do that, you would need a pointer that points to unallocate d memory or you would have\\nto refer to an array location that lies outside the range allo cated for the array . As explained\\nabove, neither of these is possible in Java. (However, there could conceivably still be errors in\\nJava’s standard classes, since some of the methods in these c lasses are actually written in the\\nC programming language rather than in Java.)\\nIt’s clear that language design can help prevent errors or de tect them when they occur.\\nDoing so involves restricting what a programmer is allowed t o do. Or it requires tests, such as\\nchecking whether a pointer is null, that take some extra processing time. Some programmers\\nfeel that the sacriﬁce of power and eﬃciency is too high a pric e to pay for the extra security . In\\nsome applications, this is true. However, there are many sit uations where safety and security\\nare primary considerations. Java is designed for such situa tions.'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS 377\\n8.1.3 Problems Remain in Java\\nThere is one area where the designers of Java chose not to dete ct errors automatically: numerical\\ncomputations. In Java, a value of type int is represented as a 32-bit binary number. With 32\\nbits, it’s possible to represent a little over four billion d iﬀerent values. The values of type int\\nrange from -2147483648 to 2147483647. What happens when the result of a computation lies\\noutside this range? F or example, what is 2147483647 + 1? And what is 2000000000 * 2? The\\nmathematically correct result in each case cannot be repres ented as a value of type int. These\\nare examples of integer overﬂow . In most cases, integer overﬂow should be considered an\\nerror. However, Java does not automatically detect such err ors. F or example, it will compute\\nthe value of 2147483647 + 1 to be the negative number, -2147483648. (What happens is\\nthat any extra bits beyond the 32-nd bit in the correct answer are discarded. V alues greater\\nthan 2147483647 will “wrap around” to negative values. Math ematically speaking, the result\\nis always “correct modulo 2 32”.)\\nF or example, consider the 3N+1 program, which was discussed in Subsection 3.2.2. Starting\\nfrom a positive integer N, the program computes a certain sequence of integers:\\nwhile ( N != 1 ) {\\nif ( N % 2 == 0 ) // If N is even...\\nN = N / 2;\\nelse\\nN = 3 * N + 1;\\nSystem.out.println(N);\\n}\\nBut there is a problem here: If N is too large, then the value of 3*N+1 will not be mathematically\\ncorrect because of integer overﬂow. The problem arises when ever 3*N+1 > 2147483647, that is\\nwhen N > 2147483646/3. F or a completely correct program, we should check for this p ossibility\\nbefore computing 3*N+1:\\nwhile ( N != 1 ) {\\nif ( N % 2 == 0 ) // If N is even...\\nN = N / 2;\\nelse {\\nif (N > 2147483646/3) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Sorry, but the value of N has become\");\\nSystem.out.println(\"too large for your computer!\");\\nbreak;\\n}\\nN = 3 * N + 1;\\n}\\nSystem.out.println(N);\\n}\\nThe problem here is not that the original algorithm for compu ting 3N+1 sequences was\\nwrong. The problem is that it just can’t be correctly impleme nted using 32-bit integers. Many\\nprograms ignore this type of problem. But integer overﬂow er rors have been responsible for their\\nshare of serious computer failures, and a completely robust program should take the possibility\\nof integer overﬂow into account. (The infamous “Y2K” bug was , in fact, just this sort of error.)\\nF or numbers of type double, there are even more problems. There are still overﬂow er-\\nrors, which occur when the result of a computation is outside the range of values that can be\\nrepresented as a value of type double. This range extends up to about 1.7 times 10 to the'),\n",

CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS\\npower 308. Numbers beyond this range do not “wrap around” to n egative values. Instead, they\\nare represented by special values that have no real numerica l equivalent. The special values\\nDouble.POSITIVE INFINITY and Double.NEGATIVE INFINITY represent numbers outside the\\nrange of legal values. F or example, 20 * 1e308 is computed to be Double.POSITIVE INFINITY.\\nAnother special value of type double, Double.NaN, represents an illegal or undeﬁned result.\\n(“NaN” stands for “Not a Number”.) F or example, the result of dividing by zero or taking\\nthe square root of a negative number is Double.NaN. Y ou can test whether a number x is this\\nspecial non-a-number value by calling the boolean-valued function Double.isNaN(x).\\nF or real numbers, there is the added complication that most r eal numbers can only be\\nrepresented approximately on a computer. A real number can h ave an inﬁnite number of digits\\nafter the decimal point. A value of type double is only accurate to about 15 digits. The real\\nnumber 1/3, for example, is the repeating decimal 0.333333333333..., and there is no way to\\nrepresent it exactly using a ﬁnite number of digits. Computa tions with real numbers generally\\ninvolve a loss of accuracy . In fact, if care is not exercised, the result of a large number of such\\ncomputations might be completely wrong! There is a whole ﬁel d of computer science, known as\\nnumerical analysis , which is devoted to studying algorithms that manipulate re al numbers.\\nSo you see that not all possible errors are avoided or detecte d automatically in Java. F ur-\\nthermore, even when an error is detected automatically , the system’s default response is to\\nreport the error and terminate the program. This is hardly ro bust behavior! So, a Java pro-\\ngrammer still needs to learn techniques for avoiding and dea ling with errors. These are the\\nmain topics of the rest of this chapter.\\n8.2 W riting Correct Programs\\nCorrect programs don’t just happen. It takes planning and attention to detail to avo id\\nerrors in programs. There are some techniques that programm ers can use to increase the\\nlikelihood that their programs are correct.\\n8.2.1 Provably Correct Programs\\nIn some cases, it is possible to prove that a program is correct. That is, it is possible to\\ndemonstrate mathematically that the sequence of computati ons represented by the program\\nwill always produce the correct result. Rigorous proof is di ﬃcult enough that in practice it can\\nonly be applied to fairly small programs. F urthermore, it de pends on the fact that the “correct\\nresult” has been speciﬁed correctly and completely . As I’ve already pointed out, a program\\nthat correctly meets its speciﬁcation is not useful if its sp eciﬁcation was wrong. Nevertheless,\\neven in everyday programming, we can apply some of the ideas a nd techniques that are used\\nin proving that programs are correct.\\nThe fundamental ideas are process and state. A state consists of all the information\\nrelevant to the execution of a program at a given moment durin g its execution. The state\\nincludes, for example, the values of all the variables in the program, the output that has been\\nproduced, any input that is waiting to be read, and a record of the position in the program\\nwhere the computer is working. A process is the sequence of st ates that the computer goes\\nthrough as it executes the program. F rom this point of view, t he meaning of a statement in a\\nprogram can be expressed in terms of the eﬀect that the execut ion of that statement has on the\\ncomputer’s state. As a simple example, the meaning of the ass ignment statement “ x = 7;” is\\nthat after this statement is executed, the value of the varia ble x will be 7. W e can be absolutely'),\n",

WRITING CORRECT PROGRAMS 379\\nsure of this fact, so it is something upon which we can build pa rt of a mathematical proof.\\nIn fact, it is often possible to look at a program and deduce th at some fact must be true at\\na given point during the execution of a program. F or example, consider the do loop:\\ndo {\\nTextIO.put(\"Enter a positive integer: \");\\nN = TextIO.getlnInt();\\n} while (N <= 0);\\nAfter this loop ends, we can be absolutely sure that the value of the variable N is greater than\\nzero. The loop cannot end until this condition is satisﬁed. T his fact is part of the meaning of\\nthe while loop. More generally , if a while loop uses the test “ while (⟨condition ⟩)”, then\\nafter the loop ends, we can be sure that the ⟨condition ⟩ is false. W e can then use this fact to\\ndraw further deductions about what happens as the execution of the program continues. (With\\na loop, by the way , we also have to worry about the question of w hether the loop will ever end.\\nThis is something that has to be veriﬁed separately .)\\nA fact that can be proven to be true after a given program segme nt has been executed\\nis called a postcondition of that program segment. Postconditions are known facts upo n\\nwhich we can build further deductions about the behavior of t he program. A postcondition\\nof a program as a whole is simply a fact that can be proven to be t rue after the program has\\nﬁnished executing. A program can be proven to be correct by sh owing that the postconditions\\nof the program meet the program’s speciﬁcation.\\nConsider the following program segment, where all the varia bles are of type double:\\ndisc = B*B - 4*A*C;\\nx = (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);\\nThe quadratic formula (from high-school mathematics) assu res us that the value assigned to x\\nis a solution of the equation A*x2 + B*x + C = 0, provided that the value of disc is greater\\nthan or equal to zero and the value of A is not zero. If we can assume or guarantee that\\nB*B-4*A*C >= 0 and that A != 0, then the fact that x is a solution of the equation becomes\\na postcondition of the program segment. W e say that the condi tion, B*B-4*A*C >= 0 is a\\nprecondition of the program segment. The condition that A != 0 is another precondition. A\\nprecondition is deﬁned to be condition that must be true at a g iven point in the execution of a\\nprogram in order for the program to continue correctly . A pre condition is something that you\\nwant to be true. It’s something that you have to check or force to be true, if you want your\\nprogram to be correct.\\nW e’ve encountered preconditions and postconditions once b efore, in Subsection 4.6.1. That\\nsection introduced preconditions and postconditions as a w ay of specifying the contract of\\na subroutine. As the terms are being used here, a preconditio n of a subroutine is just a\\nprecondition of the code that makes up the deﬁnition of the su broutine, and the postcondition\\nof a subroutine is a postcondition of the same code. In this se ction, we have generalized these\\nterms to make them more useful in talking about program corre ctness.\\nLet’s see how this works by considering a longer program segm ent:\\ndo {\\nTextIO.putln(\"Enter A, B, and C. B*B-4*A*C must be >= 0.\");\\nTextIO.put(\"A = \");\\nA = TextIO.getlnDouble();\\nTextIO.put(\"B = \");\\nB = TextIO.getlnDouble();\\nTextIO.put(\"C = \");'),\n",

The preconditions\\nfor the last two lines are fulﬁlled, so the postcondition tha t x is a solution of the equation A*x2\\n+ B*x + C = 0 is also valid. This program segment correctly and provably c omputes a solution\\nto the equation. (Actually , because of problems with repres enting numbers on computers, this\\nis not 100% true. The algorithm is correct, but the program is not a perfect implementation\\nof the algorithm. See the discussion in Subsection 8.1.3.)\\nHere is another variation, in which the precondition is chec ked by an if statement. In the\\nﬁrst part of the if statement, where a solution is computed and printed, we know that the\\npreconditions are fulﬁlled. In the other parts, we know that one of the preconditions fails to\\nhold. In any case, the program is correct.\\nTextIO.putln(\"Enter your values for A, B, and C.\");\\nTextIO.put(\"A = \");\\nA = TextIO.getlnDouble();\\nTextIO.put(\"B = \");\\nB = TextIO.getlnDouble();\\nTextIO.put(\"C = \");\\nC = TextIO.getlnDouble();\\nif (A != 0 && B*B - 4*A*C >= 0) {\\ndisc = B*B - 4*A*C;\\nx = (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);\\nTextIO.putln(\"A solution of A*X*X + B*X + C = 0 is \" + x);\\n}\\nelse if (A == 0) {\\nTextIO.putln(\"The value of A cannot be zero.\");\\n}\\nelse {\\nTextIO.putln(\"Since B*B - 4*A*C is less than zero, the\");\\nTextIO.putln(\"equation A*X*X + B*X + C = 0 has no solution.\");\\n}\\nWhenever you write a program, it’s a good idea to watch out for preconditions and think\\nabout how your program handles them. Often, a precondition c an oﬀer a clue about how to\\nwrite the program.\\nF or example, every array reference, such as A[i], has a precondition: The index must\\nbe within the range of legal indices for the array . F or A[i], the precondition is that 0 <= i\\n< A.length. The computer will check this condition when it evaluates A[i], and if the condition\\nis not satisﬁed, the program will be terminated. In order to a void this, you need to make sure\\nthat the index has a legal value. (There is actually another p recondition, namely that A is not\\nnull, but let’s leave that aside for the moment.) Consider the fol lowing code, which searches\\nfor the number x in the array A and sets the value of i to be the index of the array element\\nthat contains x:'),\n",

That is, the value of\\ni when the loop ends will be the position of x in the array . However, if x is not in the array ,\\nthen the value of i will just keep increasing until it is equal to A.length. At that time, the\\nreference to A[i] is illegal and the program will be terminated. T o avoid this, we can add a\\ntest to make sure that the precondition for referring to A[i] is satisﬁed:\\ni = 0;\\nwhile (i < A.length && A[i] != x) {\\ni++;\\n}\\nNow, the loop will deﬁnitely end. After it ends, i will satisfy either i == A.length or\\nA[i] == x.

Files and networking will be covered in Chapt er 11, which will make essential\\nuse of material that will be covered in the next two sections o f this chapter. F or now, let’s look\\nat an example of processing user input.\\nExamples in this textbook use my T extIO class for reading input from the user. This class\\nhas built-in error handling. F or example, the function TextIO.getDouble() is guaranteed to\\nreturn a legal value of type double. If the user types an illegal value, then T extIO will ask\\nthe user to re-enter their response; your program never sees the illegal value. However, this\\napproach can be clumsy and unsatisfactory , especially when the user is entering complex data.\\nIn the following example, I’ll do my own error-checking.\\nSometimes, it’s useful to be able to look ahead at what’s comi ng up in the input without\\nactually reading it. F or example, a program might need to kno w whether the next item in\\nthe input is a number or a word. F or this purpose, the T extIO class includes the function\\nTextIO.peek(). This function returns a char which is the next character in the user’s input,\\nbut it does not actually read that character. If the next thin g in the input is an end-of-line,\\nthen TextIO.peek() returns the new-line character, ’\\\\n’.\\nOften, what we really need to know is the next non-blank character in the user’s input.\\nBefore we can test this, we need to skip past any spaces (and ta bs). Here is a function that does'),\n",

CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS\\nthis. It uses TextIO.peek() to look ahead, and it reads characters until the next charact er in the\\ninput is either an end-of-line or some non-blank character. (The function TextIO.getAnyChar()\\nreads and returns the next character in the user’s input, eve n if that character is a space. By\\ncontrast, the more common TextIO.getChar() would skip any blanks and then read and return\\nthe next non-blank character. W e can’t use TextIO.getChar() here since the object is to skip\\nthe blanks without reading the next non-blank character.)\\n/**\\n* Reads past any blanks and tabs in the input.\\n* Postcondition: The next character in the input is an\\n* end-of-line or a non-blank character.\\n*/\\nstatic void skipBlanks() {\\nchar ch;\\nch = TextIO.peek();\\nwhile (ch == ’ ’ || ch == ’\\\\t’) {\\n// Next character is a space or tab; read it\\n// and look at the character that follows it.\\nch = TextIO.getAnyChar();\\nch = TextIO.peek();\\n}\\n} // end skipBlanks()\\n(In fact, this operation is so common that it is built into the most recent version of TextIO. The\\nmethod TextIO.skipBlanks() does essentially the same thing as the skipBlanks() method\\npresented here.)\\nAn example in Subsection 3.5.3 allowed the user to enter leng th measurements such as “3\\nmiles” or “1 foot”. It would then convert the measurement int o inches, feet, yards, and miles.\\nBut people commonly use combined measurements such as “3 fee t 7 inches”. Let’s improve the\\nprogram so that it allows inputs of this form.\\nMore speciﬁcally , the user will input lines containing one o r more measurements such as “1\\nfoot” or “3 miles 20 yards 2 feet”. The legal units of measure a re inch, foot, yard, and mile.\\nThe program will also recognize plurals (inches, feet, yard s, miles) and abbreviations (in, ft,\\nyd, mi). Let’s write a subroutine that will read one line of in put of this form and compute\\nthe equivalent number of inches. The main program uses the nu mber of inches to compute the\\nequivalent number of feet, yards, and miles. If there is any e rror in the input, the subroutine\\nwill print an error message and return the value -1. The subroutine assumes that the input\\nline is not empty . The main program tests for this before call ing the subroutine and uses an\\nempty line as a signal for ending the program.\\nIgnoring the possibility of illegal inputs, a pseudocode al gorithm for the subroutine is\\ninches = 0 // This will be the total number of inches\\nwhile there is more input on the line:\\nread the numerical measurement\\nread the units of measure\\nadd the measurement to inches\\nreturn inches\\nW e can test whether there is more input on the line by checking whether the next non-blank\\ncharacter is the end-of-line character. But this test has a p recondition: Before we can test the\\nnext non-blank character, we have to skip over any blanks. So , the algorithm becomes'),\n",

This subroutine must be executed\\nbefore the computer returns to the test at the beginning of th e loop. More generally , if the test\\nin a while loop has a precondition, then you have to make sure that this p recondition holds at\\nthe end of the while loop, before the computer jumps back to re-evalu ate the test.\\nWhat about error checking? Before reading the numerical mea surement, we have to make\\nsure that there is really a number there to read. Before readi ng the unit of measure, we have to\\ntest that there is something there to read. (The number might have been the last thing on the\\nline. An input such as “3”, without a unit of measure, is illeg al.) Also, we have to check that\\nthe unit of measure is one of the valid units: inches, feet, ya rds, or miles. Here is an algorithm\\nthat includes error-checking:\\ninches = 0\\nskipBlanks()\\nwhile TextIO.peek() is not ’\\\\n’:\\nif the next character is not a digit:\\nreport an error and return -1\\nLet measurement = TextIO.getDouble();\\nskipBlanks() // Precondition for the next test!!\\nif the next character is end-of-line:\\nreport an error and return -1\\nLet units = TextIO.getWord()\\nif the units are inches:\\nadd measurement to inches\\nelse if the units are feet:\\nadd 12*measurement to inches\\nelse if the units are yards:\\nadd 36*measurement to inches\\nelse if the units are miles:\\nadd 12*5280*measurement to inches\\nelse\\nreport an error and return -1\\nskipBlanks()\\nreturn inches\\nAs you can see, error-testing adds signiﬁcantly to the compl exity of the algorithm. Y et\\nthis is still a fairly simple example, and it doesn’t even han dle all the possible errors. F or\\nexample, if the user enters a numerical measurement such as 1e400 that is outside the legal\\nrange of values of type double, then the program will fall back on the default error-handli ng\\nin T extIO.

A robust program can survive unusual or “exceptional” circ umstances\\nwithout crashing. One approach to writing robust programs i s to anticipate the problems that\\nmight arise and to include tests in the program for each possi ble problem. F or example, a\\nprogram will crash if it tries to use an array element A[i], when i is not within the declared\\nrange of indices for the array A. A robust program must anticipate the possibility of a bad in dex\\nand guard against it. One way to do this is to write the program in a way that ensures that\\nthe index is in the legal range. Another way is to test whether the index value is legal before\\nusing it in the array . This could be done with an if statement:\\nif (i < 0 || i >= A.length) {\\n... // Do something to handle the out-of-range index, i\\n}\\nelse {\\n... // Process the array element, A[i]\\n}'),\n",

CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS\\nThere are some problems with this approach. It is diﬃcult and sometimes impossible to an-\\nticipate all the possible things that might go wrong. It’s no t always clear what to do when an\\nerror is detected. F urthermore, trying to anticipate all th e possible problems can turn what\\nwould otherwise be a straightforward program into a messy ta ngle of if statements.\\n8.3.1 Exceptions and Exception Classes\\nW e have already seen that Java (like its cousin, C++) provide s a neater, more structured\\nalternative method for dealing with errors that can occur wh ile a program is running. The\\nmethod is referred to as exception handling . The word “exception” is meant to be more\\ngeneral than “error.” It includes any circumstance that ari ses as the program is executed which\\nis meant to be treated as an exception to the normal ﬂow of cont rol of the program. An\\nexception might be an error, or it might just be a special case that you would rather not have\\nclutter up your elegant algorithm.\\nWhen an exception occurs during the execution of a program, w e say that the exception\\nis thrown. When this happens, the normal ﬂow of the program is thrown oﬀ -track, and the\\nprogram is in danger of crashing. However, the crash can be av oided if the exception is caught\\nand handled in some way . An exception can be thrown in one part of a program and caught\\nin a diﬀerent part. An exception that is not caught will gener ally cause the program to crash.\\n(More exactly , the thread that throws the exception will cra sh. In a multithreaded program,\\nit is possible for other threads to continue even after one cr ashes. W e will cover threads in\\nSection 8.5. In particular, GUI programs are multithreaded , and parts of the program might\\ncontinue to function even while other parts are non-functio nal because of exceptions.)\\nBy the way , since Java programs are executed by a Java interpr eter, having a program\\ncrash simply means that it terminates abnormally and premat urely . It doesn’t mean that\\nthe Java interpreter will crash. In eﬀect, the interpreter c atches any exceptions that are not\\ncaught by the program. The interpreter responds by terminat ing the program. In many other\\nprogramming languages, a crashed program will sometimes cr ash the entire system and freeze\\nthe computer until it is restarted. With Java, such system cr ashes should be impossible—which\\nmeans that when they happen, you have the satisfaction of bla ming the system rather than\\nyour own program.\\nExceptions were introduced in Section 3.7, along with the try..catch statement, which is\\nused to catch and handle exceptions. However, that section d id not cover the complete syntax\\nof try..catch or the full complexity of exceptions. In this section, we cov er these topics in full\\ndetail.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nWhen an exception occurs, the thing that is actually “thrown ” is an object. This object\\ncan carry information (in its instance variables) from the p oint where the exception occurs to\\nthe point where it is caught and handled. This information al ways includes the subroutine\\ncall stack , which is a list of the subroutines that were being executed w hen the exception was\\nthrown. (Since one subroutine can call another, several sub routines can be active at the same\\ntime.) Typically , an exception object also includes an erro r message describing what happened\\nto cause the exception, and it can contain other data as well. All exception objects must belong\\nto a subclass of the standard class java.lang.Throwable. In general, each diﬀerent type of\\nexception is represented by its own subclass of Throwable, and these subclasses are arranged in\\na fairly complex class hierarchy that shows the relationshi p among various types of exception.\\nThrowable has two direct subclasses, Error and Exception. These two subclasses in turn have'),\n",

EXCEPTIONS AND TR Y..CA TCH 387\\nmany other predeﬁned subclasses. In addition, a programmer can create new exception classes\\nto represent new types of exception.\\nMost of the subclasses of the class Error represent serious errors within the Java virtual\\nmachine that should ordinarily cause program termination b ecause there is no reasonable way\\nto handle them. In general, you should not try to catch and han dle such errors. An example is\\na ClassFormatError, which occurs when the Java virtual machine ﬁnds some kind of illegal data\\nin a ﬁle that is supposed to contain a compiled Java class. If t hat class was being loaded as\\npart of the program, then there is really no way for the progra m to proceed.\\nOn the other hand, subclasses of the class Exception represent exceptions that are meant\\nto be caught. In many cases, these are exceptions that might n aturally be called “errors,” but\\nthey are errors in the program or in input data that a programm er can anticipate and possibly\\nrespond to in some reasonable way . (However, you should avoi d the temptation of saying, “W ell,\\nI’ll just put a thing here to catch all the errors that might oc cur, so my program won’t crash.”\\nIf you don’t have a reasonable way to respond to the error, it’ s best just to let the program\\ncrash, because trying to go on will probably only lead to wors e things down the road—in the\\nworst case, a program that gives an incorrect answer without giving you any indication that\\nthe answer might be wrong!)\\nThe class Exception has its own subclass, RuntimeException. This class groups together\\nmany common exceptions, including all those that have been c overed in previous sections. F or\\nexample, IllegalArgumentException and NullPointerException are subclasses of RuntimeException.\\nA RuntimeException generally indicates a bug in the program, which the programm er should\\nﬁx. RuntimeExceptions and Errors share the property that a program can simply ignore the\\npossibility that they might occur. (“Ignoring” here means t hat you are content to let your\\nprogram crash if the exception occurs.) F or example, a progr am does this every time it uses\\nan array reference like A[i] without making arrangements to catch a possible ArrayIndexOut-\\nOfBoundsException. F or all other exception classes besides Error, RuntimeException, and their\\nsubclasses, exception-handling is “mandatory” in a sense t hat I’ll discuss below.\\nThe following diagram is a class hierarchy showing the class Throwable and just a few of\\nits subclasses. Classes that require mandatory exception- handling are shown in italic:\\nT h r o w a b l e\\nE x c e p t i o n\\nI O E x c e p t i o nI n t e r r u p t e d E x c e p t i o n\\nS\\no c k e t E x c e p t i o nE O F E x c e p t i o n\\nE r r o r\\nR u n t i m e E x c e p t i o n\\nA\\nr r a y I n d e x O u t O f B o u n d s E x c e p t i o n\\nI l l e g a l\\nA\\nr g u m e n t E x c e p t i o n\\nN u m b e r f F o r m a t E x c e p t i o n\\nT h e c l a s s \" T h r o w a b l e \"\\na n d s o m e o f\\ni t\\ns s u b c l a s s e s .\\nThe class Throwable includes several instance methods that can be used with any e xception\\nobject.

The function e.toString(), which is used\\nby the system whenever it needs a string representation of th e object, returns a String that\\ncontains the name of the class to which the exception belongs as well as the same string that\\nwould be returned by e.getMessage(). And e.printStackTrace() writes a stack trace to\\nstandard output that tells which subroutines were active wh en the exception occurred. A stack\\ntrace can be very useful when you are trying to determine the c ause of the problem. (Note that\\nif an exception is not caught by the program, then the system automatically prints the stack\\ntrace to standard output.)\\n8.3.2 The try Statement\\nT o catch exceptions in a Java program, you need a try statement. W e have been using such\\nstatements since Section 3.7, but the full syntax of the try statement is more complicated than\\nwhat was presented there. The try statements that we have used so far had a syntax similar\\nto the following example:\\ntry {\\ndouble determinant = M[0][0]*M[1][1] - M[0][1]*M[1][0];\\nSystem.out.println(\"The determinant of M is \" + determinant);\\n}\\ncatch ( ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e ) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"M is the wrong size to have a determinant.\");\\ne.printStackTrace();\\n}\\nHere, the computer tries to execute the block of statements f ollowing the word “ try”. If no\\nexception occurs during the execution of this block, then th e “ catch” part of the statement\\nis simply ignored. However, if an exception of type ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs,\\nthen the computer jumps immediately to the catch clause of the try statement. This block\\nof statements is said to be an exception handler for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. By\\nhandling the exception in this way , you prevent it from crash ing the program. Before the body\\nof the catch clause is executed, the object that represents the exceptio n is assigned to the\\nvariable e, which is used in this example to print a stack trace.\\nHowever, the full syntax of the try statement allows more than one catch clause. This\\nmakes it possible to catch several diﬀerent types of excepti on with one try statement. In the\\nabove example, in addition to the possible ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, there is a possible\\nNullPointerException which will occur if the value of M is null. W e can handle both possible\\nexceptions by adding a second catch clause to the try statement:\\ntry {\\ndouble determinant = M[0][0]*M[1][1] - M[0][1]*M[1][0];\\nSystem.out.println(\"The determinant of M is \" + determinant);\\n}\\ncatch ( ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e ) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"M is the wrong size to have a determinant.\");\\n}\\ncatch ( NullPointerException e ) {\\nSystem.out.print(\"Programming error! M doesn’t exist.\" + );\\n}\\nHere, the computer tries to execute the statements in the try clause. If no error occurs, both\\nof the catch clauses are skipped. If an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs, the computer'),\n",

EXCEPTIONS AND TR Y..CA TCH 389\\nexecutes the body of the ﬁrst catch clause and skips the second one. If a NullPointerException\\noccurs, it jumps to the second catch clause and executes that.\\nNote that both ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and NullPointerException are subclasses of\\nRuntimeException. It’s possible to catch all RuntimeExceptions with a single catch clause. F or\\nexample:\\ntry {\\ndouble determinant = M[0][0]*M[1][1] - M[0][1]*M[1][0];\\nSystem.out.println(\"The determinant of M is \" + determinant);\\n}\\ncatch ( RuntimeException err ) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Sorry, an error has occurred.\");\\nSystem.out.println(\"The error was: \" + err);\\n}\\nThe catch clause in this try statement will catch any exception belonging to class RuntimeEx-\\nception or to any of its subclasses. This shows why exception classes are organized into a class\\nhierarchy . It allows you the option of casting your net narro wly to catch only a speciﬁc type\\nof exception. Or you can cast your net widely to catch a wide cl ass of exceptions. Because\\nof subclassing, when there are multiple catch clauses in a try statement, it is possible that a\\ngiven exception might match several of those catch clauses. F or example, an exception of type\\nNullPointerException would match catch clauses for NullPointerException, RuntimeException,\\nException, or Throwable. In this case, only the ﬁrst catch clause that matches the exception\\nis executed.\\nThe example I’ve given here is not particularly realistic. Y ou are not very likely to use\\nexception-handling to guard against null pointers and bad a rray indices. This is a case where\\ncareful programming is better than exception handling: Jus t be sure that your program assigns\\na reasonable, non- null value to the array M. Y ou would certainly resent it if the designers of\\nJava forced you to set up a try..catch statement every time you wanted to use an array!\\nThis is why handling of potential RuntimeExceptions is not mandatory . There are just too\\nmany things that might go wrong! (This also shows that except ion-handling does not solve\\nthe problem of program robustness. It just gives you a tool th at will in many cases let you\\napproach the problem in a more organized way .)\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nI have still not completely speciﬁed the syntax of the try statement. There is one additional\\nelement: the possibility of a ﬁnally clause at the end of a try statement. The complete syntax\\nof the try statement can be described as:\\ntry {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\n⟨optional-catch-clauses ⟩\\n⟨optional-finally-clause ⟩\\nNote that the catch clauses are also listed as optional. The try statement can include zero or\\nmore catch clauses and, optionally , a finally clause. The try statement must include one\\nor the other. That is, a try statement can have either a finally clause, or one or more catch\\nclauses, or both. The syntax for a catch clause is\\ncatch ( ⟨exception-class-name ⟩ ⟨variable-name ⟩ ) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}'),\n",

CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS\\nand the syntax for a finally clause is\\nfinally {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nThe semantics of the finally clause is that the block of statements in the finally clause is\\nguaranteed to be executed as the last step in the execution of the try statement, whether or not\\nany exception occurs and whether or not any exception that do es occur is caught and handled.\\nThe finally clause is meant for doing essential cleanup that under no cir cumstances should\\nbe omitted. One example of this type of cleanup is closing a ne twork connection. Although\\nyou don’t yet know enough about networking to look at the actu al programming in this case,\\nwe can consider some pseudocode:\\ntry {\\nopen a network connection\\n}\\ncatch ( IOException e ) {\\nreport the error\\nreturn // Don’t continue if connection can’t be opened!\\n}\\n// At this point, we KNOW that the connection is open.\\ntry {\\ncommunicate over the connection\\n}\\ncatch ( IOException e ) {\\nhandle the error\\n}\\nfinally {\\nclose the connection\\n}\\nThe finally clause in the second try statement ensures that the network connection will\\ndeﬁnitely be closed, whether or not an error occurs during th e communication. The ﬁrst try\\nstatement is there to make sure that we don’t even try to commu nicate over the network unless\\nwe have successfully opened a connection. The pseudocode in this example follows a general\\npattern that can be used to robustly obtain a resource, use th e resource, and then release the\\nresource.\\n8.3.3 Throwing Exceptions\\nThere are times when it makes sense for a program to deliberat ely throw an exception. This\\nis the case when the program discovers some sort of exception al or error condition, but there\\nis no reasonable way to handle the error at the point where the problem is discovered. The\\nprogram can throw an exception in the hope that some other par t of the program will catch\\nand handle the exception. This can be done with a throw statement . Y ou have already seen\\nan example of this in Subsection 4.3.5. In this section, we co ver the throw statement more\\nfully . The syntax of the throw statement is:\\nthrow ⟨exception-object ⟩ ;'),\n",

In most cases, it will be a\\nnewly constructed object created with the new operator. F or example:\\nthrow new ArithmeticException(\"Division by zero\");\\nThe parameter in the constructor becomes the error message i n the exception object; if e\\nrefers to the object, the error message can be retrieved by ca lling e.getMessage(). (Y ou\\nmight ﬁnd this example a bit odd, because you might expect the system itself to throw an\\nArithmeticException when an attempt is made to divide by zero. So why should a progr ammer\\nbother to throw the exception? Recall that if the numbers tha t are being divided are of type\\nint, then division by zero will indeed throw an ArithmeticException. However, no arithmetic\\noperations with ﬂoating-point numbers will ever produce an exception. Instead, the special\\nvalue Double.NaN is used to represent the result of an illegal operation. In so me situations, you\\nmight prefer to throw an ArithmeticException when a real number is divided by zero.)\\nAn exception can be thrown either by the system or by a throw statement. The exception\\nis processed in exactly the same way in either case. Suppose t hat the exception is thrown\\ninside a try statement. If that try statement has a catch clause that handles that type of\\nexception, then the computer jumps to the catch clause and executes it. The exception has\\nbeen handled . After handling the exception, the computer executes the finally clause of\\nthe try statement, if there is one. It then continues normally with t he rest of the program,\\nwhich follows the try statement. If the exception is not immediately caught and ha ndled, the\\nprocessing of the exception will continue.\\nWhen an exception is thrown during the execution of a subrout ine and the exception is\\nnot handled in the same subroutine, then that subroutine is t erminated (after the execution\\nof any pending finally clauses). Then the routine that called that subroutine gets a chance\\nto handle the exception. That is, if the subroutine was calle d inside a try statement that has\\nan appropriate catch clause, then that catch clause will be executed and the program will\\ncontinue on normally from there. Again, if the second routin e does not handle the exception,\\nthen it also is terminated and the routine that called it (if any) gets the next shot at the\\nexception. The exception will crash the program only if it pa sses up through the entire chain of\\nsubroutine calls without being handled. (In fact, even this is not quite true: In a multithreaded\\nprogram, only the thread in which the exception occurred is t erminated.)\\nA subroutine that might generate an exception can announce t his fact by adding a clause\\n“ throws ⟨exception-class-name⟩” to the header of the routine. F or example:\\n/**\\n* Returns the larger of the two roots of the quadratic equation\\n* A*x*x + B*x + C = 0, provided it has any roots.

The subroutine throws an exception of type Ille-\\ngalArgumentException when either of these preconditions is violated. When an ille gal condition\\nis found in a subroutine, throwing an exception is often a rea sonable response. If the program\\nthat called the subroutine knows some good way to handle the e rror, it can catch the exception.\\nIf not, the program will crash—and the programmer will know t hat the program needs to be\\nﬁxed.\\nA throws clause in a subroutine heading can declare several diﬀerent types of exception,\\nseparated by commas. F or example:\\nvoid processArray(int[] A) throws NullPointerException,\\nArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException { ...\\n8.3.4 Mandatory Exception Handling\\nIn the preceding example, declaring that the subroutine root() can throw an IllegalArgumentEx-\\nception is just a courtesy to potential readers of this routine. This is because handling of Il-\\nlegalArgumentExceptions is not “mandatory .” A routine can throw an IllegalArgumentException\\nwithout announcing the possibility . And a program that call s that routine is free either to catch\\nor to ignore the exception, just as a programmer can choose ei ther to catch or to ignore an\\nexception of type NullPointerException.\\nF or those exception classes that require mandatory handlin g, the situation is diﬀerent. If a\\nsubroutine can throw such an exception, that fact must be announced in a throws clause in\\nthe routine deﬁnition. F ailing to do so is a syntax error that will be reported by the compiler.\\nOn the other hand, suppose that some statement in the body of a subroutine can generate\\nan exception of a type that requires mandatory handling. The statement could be a throw\\nstatement, which throws the exception directly , or it could be a call to a subroutine that can\\nthrow the exception. In either case, the exception must be handled. This can be done in one\\nof two ways: The ﬁrst way is to place the statement in a try statement that has a catch clause\\nthat handles the exception; in this case, the exception is ha ndled within the subroutine, so that\\nany caller of the subroutine will never see the exception. Th e second way is to declare that the\\nsubroutine can throw the exception. This is done by adding a “ throws” clause to the subroutine\\nheading, which alerts any callers to the possibility that an exception might be generated when\\nthe subroutine is executed. The caller will, in turn, be forc ed either to handle the exception in\\na try statement or to declare the exception in a throws clause in its own header.\\nException-handling is mandatory for any exception class th at is not a subclass of either\\nError or RuntimeException. Exceptions that require mandatory handling generally rep resent\\nconditions that are outside the control of the programmer. F or example, they might represent\\nbad input or an illegal action taken by the user. There is no wa y to avoid such errors, so a\\nrobust program has to be prepared to handle them. The design o f Java makes it impossible for\\nprogrammers to ignore the possibility of such errors.\\nAmong the exceptions that require mandatory handling are se veral that can occur when\\nusing Java’s input/output routines.

Without exceptions, a progra m can become cluttered with if\\nstatements that test for various possible error conditions . With exceptions, it becomes possible\\nto write a clean implementation of an algorithm that will han dle all the normal cases. The\\nexceptional cases can be handled elsewhere, in a catch clause of a try statement.\\nWhen a program encounters an exceptional condition and has n o way of handling it im-\\nmediately , the program can throw an exception. In some cases , it makes sense to throw an\\nexception belonging to one of Java’s predeﬁned classes, suc h as IllegalArgumentException or\\nIOException. However, if there is no standard class that adequately repr esents the exceptional\\ncondition, the programmer can deﬁne a new exception class. T he new class must extend the\\nstandard class Throwable or one of its subclasses. In general, if the programmer does not want\\nto require mandatory exception handling, the new class will extend RuntimeException (or one\\nof its subclasses). T o create a new exception class that does require mandatory handling, the\\nprogrammer can extend one of the other subclasses of Exception or can extend Exception itself.\\nHere, for example, is a class that extends Exception, and therefore requires mandatory\\nexception handling when it is used:\\npublic class ParseError extends Exception {\\npublic ParseError(String message) {\\n// Create a ParseError object containing\\n// the given message as its error message.\\nsuper(message);\\n}\\n}\\nThe class contains only a constructor that makes it possible to create a ParseError object\\ncontaining a given error message. (The statement “ super(message)” calls a constructor in the\\nsuperclass, Exception. See Subsection 5.6.3.) Of course the class inherits the getMessage() and\\nprintStackTrace() routines from its superclass. If e refers to an object of type ParseError,\\nthen the function call e.getMessage() will retrieve the error message that was speciﬁed in the\\nconstructor. But the main point of the ParseError class is simply to exist. When an object of\\ntype ParseError is thrown, it indicates that a certain type of error has occur red. ( Parsing , by\\nthe way , refers to ﬁguring out the syntax of a string. A ParseError would indicate, presumably ,\\nthat some string that is being processed by the program does n ot have the expected form.)\\nA throw statement can be used in a program to throw an error of type ParseError. The\\nconstructor for the ParseError object must specify an error message. F or example:\\nthrow new ParseError(\"Encountered an illegal negative number.\");\\nor\\nthrow new ParseError(\"The word ’\" + word\\n+ \"’ is not a valid file name.\");\\nIf the throw statement does not occur in a try statement that catches the error, then the\\nsubroutine that contains the throw statement must declare that it can throw a ParseError by\\nadding the clause “ throws ParseError” to the subroutine heading. F or example,\\nvoid getUserData() throws ParseError {\\n. . .\\n}'),\n",

CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS\\nThis would not be required if ParseError were deﬁned as a subclass of RuntimeException instead\\nof Exception, since in that case exception handling for ParseErrors would not be mandatory .\\nA routine that wants to handle ParseErrors can use a try statement with a catch clause\\nthat catches ParseErrors. F or example:\\ntry {\\ngetUserData();\\nprocessUserData();\\n}\\ncatch (ParseError pe) {\\n. . . // Handle the error\\n}\\nNote that since ParseError is a subclass of Exception, a catch clause of the form “ catch\\n(Exception e)” would also catch ParseErrors, along with any other object of type Exception.\\nSometimes, it’s useful to store extra data in an exception ob ject. F or example,\\nclass ShipDestroyed extends RuntimeException {\\nShip ship; // Which ship was destroyed.\\nint where\\nx, where y; // Location where ship was destroyed.\\nShipDestroyed(String message, Ship s, int x, int y) {\\n// Constructor creates a ShipDestroyed object\\n// carrying an error message plus the information\\n// that the ship s was destroyed at location (x,y)\\n// on the screen.\\nsuper(message);\\nship = s;\\nwhere\\nx = x;\\nwhere y = y;\\n}\\n}\\nHere, a ShipDestroyed object contains an error message and some information about a ship that\\nwas destroyed. This could be used, for example, in a statemen t:\\nif ( userShip.isHit() )\\nthrow new ShipDestroyed(\"You’ve been hit!\", userShip, xPos, yPos);\\nNote that the condition represented by a ShipDestroyed object might not even be considered\\nan error. It could be just an expected interruption to the nor mal ﬂow of a game. Exceptions\\ncan sometimes be used to handle such interruptions neatly .\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe ability to throw exceptions is particularly useful in wr iting general-purpose subroutines\\nand classes that are meant to be used in more than one program. In this case, the person writing\\nthe subroutine or class often has no reasonable way of handli ng the error, since that person has\\nno way of knowing exactly how the subroutine or class will be u sed. In such circumstances,\\na novice programmer is often tempted to print an error messag e and forge ahead, but this is\\nalmost never satisfactory since it can lead to unpredictabl e results down the line. Printing an\\nerror message and terminating the program is almost as bad, s ince it gives the program no\\nchance to handle the error.\\nThe program that calls the subroutine or uses the class needs to know that the error has\\noccurred.

However, this only does any good if the main program bothers to test the\\nreturn value. It is very easy to be lazy about checking for spe cial return values every time a\\nsubroutine is called.

ASSER TIONS 397\\nthere is a chance that the precondition might not be satisﬁed —for example, if it depends on\\ninput from the user—then it’s a good idea to insert an if statement to test it. But then the\\nquestion arises, What should be done if the precondition doe s not hold? One option is to throw\\nan exception. This will terminate the program, unless the ex ception is caught and handled\\nelsewhere in the program.\\nIn many cases, of course, instead of using an if statement to test whether a precondition\\nholds, a programmer tries to write the program in a way that wi ll guarantee that the precondi-\\ntion holds. In that case, the test should not be necessary , an d the if statement can be avoided.\\nThe problem is that programmers are not perfect. In spite of t he programmer’s intention, the\\nprogram might contain a bug that screws up the precondition. So maybe it’s a good idea to\\ncheck the precondition—at least during the debugging phase of program development.\\nSimilarly , a postcondition is a condition that is true at a ce rtain point in the program as\\na consequence of the code that has been executed before that p oint. Assuming that the code\\nis correctly written, a postcondition is guaranteed to be tr ue, but here again testing whether a\\ndesired postcondition is actually true is a way of checking for a bug that might have screwed\\nup the postcondition. This is somthing that might be desirab le during debugging.\\nThe programming languages C and C++ have always had a facilit y for adding what are\\ncalled assertions to a program. These assertions take the form “ assert(⟨condition⟩)”, where\\n⟨condition⟩ is a boolean-valued expression. This condition expresses a preconditi on or post-\\ncondition that should hold at that point in the program. When the computer encounters an\\nassertion during the execution of the program, it evaluates the condition. If the condition is\\nfalse, the program is terminated. Otherwise, the program co ntinues normally . This allows the\\nprogrammer’s belief that the condition is true to be tested; if if it not true, that indicates that\\nthe part of the program that preceded the assertion containe d a bug. One nice thing about as-\\nsertions in C and C++ is that they can be “turned oﬀ” at compile time. That is, if the program\\nis compiled in one way , then the assertions are included in th e compiled code. If the program\\nis compiled in another way , the assertions are not included. During debugging, the ﬁrst type of\\ncompilation is used. The release version of the program is co mpiled with assertions turned oﬀ.\\nThe release version will be more eﬃcient, because the comput er won’t have to evaluate all the\\nassertions.\\nAlthough early versions of Java did not have assertions, an a ssertion facility similar to the\\none in C/C++ has been available in Java since version 1.4. As w ith the C/C++ version, Java\\nassertions can be turned on during debugging and turned oﬀ du ring normal execution. In Java,\\nhowever, assertions are turned on and oﬀ at run time rather th an at compile time. An assertion\\nin the Java source code is always included in the compiled cla ss ﬁle. When the program is\\nrun in the normal way , these assertions are ignored; since th e condition in the assertion is not\\nevaluated in this case, there is little or no performance pen alty for having the assertions in\\nthe program. When the program is being debugged, it can be run with assertions enabled, as\\ndiscussed below, and then the assertions can be a great help i n locating and identifying bugs.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nAn assertion statement in Java takes one of the following two forms:\\nassert ⟨condition ⟩ ;\\nor\\nassert ⟨condition ⟩ : ⟨error-message ⟩ ;\\nwhere ⟨condition⟩ is a boolean-valued expression and ⟨error-message⟩ is a string or an expres-\\nsion of type String.

An assertion statement can be used anyplace in Ja va where a statement is legal.\\nIf a program is run with assertions disabled, an assertion st atement is equivalent to an\\nempty statement and has no eﬀect. When assertions are enable d and an assertion statement is\\nencountered in the program, the ⟨condition⟩ in the assertion is evaluated. If the value is true,\\nthe program proceeds normally . If the value of the condition is false, then an exception of\\ntype java.lang.AssertionError is thrown, and the program will crash (unless the error is\\ncaught by a try statement). If the assert statement includes an ⟨error-message⟩, then the\\nerror message string becomes the message in the AssertionError.\\nSo, the statement “ assert ⟨condition ⟩ : ⟨error-message ⟩;\" is similar to\\nif ( ⟨condition ⟩ == false )\\nthrow new AssertionError( ⟨error-message ⟩ );\\nexcept that the if statement is executed whenever the program is run, and the assert state-\\nment is executed only when the program is run with assertions enabled.\\nThe question is, when to use assertions instead of exception s? The general rule is to use\\nassertions to test conditions that should deﬁnitely be true , if the program is written correctly .\\nAssertions are useful for testing a program to see whether or not it is correct and for ﬁnding\\nthe errors in an incorrect program. After testing and debugg ing, when the program is used in\\nthe normal way , the assertions in the program will be ignored . However, if a problem turns\\nup later, the assertions are still there in the program to be u sed to help locate the error. If\\nsomeone writes to you to say that your program doesn’t work wh en he does such-and-such, you\\ncan run the program with assertions enabled, do such-and-su ch, and hope that the assertions\\nin the program will help you locate the point in the program wh ere it goes wrong.\\nConsider, for example, the root() method from Subsection 8.3.3 that calculates a root of\\na quadratic equation. If you believe that your program will a lways call this method with legal\\narguments, then it would make sense to write the method using assertions instead of exceptions:\\n/**\\n* Returns the larger of the two roots of the quadratic equation\\n* A*x*x + B*x + C = 0, provided it has any roots.\\n* Precondition: A != 0 and B*B - 4*A*C >= 0.\\n*/\\nstatic public double root( double A, double B, double C ) {\\nassert A != 0 : \"Leading coefficient of quadratic equation cannot be zero.\";\\ndouble disc = B*B - 4*A*C;\\nassert disc >= 0 : \"Discriminant of quadratic equation cannot be negative.\";\\nreturn (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);\\n}\\nThe assertions are not checked when the program is run in the n ormal way . If you are correct in\\nyour belief that the method is never called with illegal argu ments, then checking the conditions\\nin the assertions would be unnecessary . If your belief is not correct, the problem should turn\\nup during testing or debugging, when the program is run with t he assertions enabled.\\nIf the root() method is part of a software library that you expect other peo ple to use, then\\nthe situation is less clear. Sun’s Java documentation advis es that assertions should not be used\\nfor checking the contract of public methods: If the caller of a method violates the contract by\\npassing illegal parameters, then an exception should be thr own. This will enforce the contract\\nwhether or not assertions are enabled. (However, while it’s true that Java programmers expect\\nthe contract of a method to be enforced with exceptions, ther e are reasonable arguments for\\nusing assertions instead, in some cases.)'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO THREADS 399\\nOn the other hand, it never hurts to use an assertion to check a postcondition of a method.\\nA postcondition is something that is supposed to be true afte r the method has executed, and it\\ncan be tested with an assert statement at the end of the method. If the postcodition is fal se,\\nthere is a bug in the method itself, and that is something that needs to be found during the\\ndevelopment of the method.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nT o have any eﬀect, assertions must be enabled when the program is run. How to do this\\ndepends on what programming environment you are using. (See Section 2.6 for a discussion of\\nprogramming environments.) In the usual command line envir onment, assertions are enabled by\\nadding the option -enableassertions to the java command that is used to run the program.\\nF or example, if the class that contains the main program is RootFinder, then the command\\njava -enableassertions RootFinder\\nwill run the program with assertions enabled. The -enableassertions option can be abbre-\\nviated to -ea, so the command can alternatively be written as\\njava -ea RootFinder\\nIn fact, it is possible to enable assertions in just part of a p rogram. An option of the form\\n“ -ea:⟨class-name ⟩” enables only the assertions in the speciﬁed class. Note tha t there are no\\nspaces between the -ea, the “:”, and the name of the class. T o enable all the assertio ns in a\\npackage and in its sub-packages, you can use an option of the f orm “ -ea:⟨package-name ⟩...”.\\nT o enable assertions in the “default package” (that is, clas ses that are not speciﬁed to belong to\\na package, like almost all the classes in this book), use “ -ea:...”. F or example, to run a Java\\nprogram named “MegaPaint” with assertions enabled for ever y class in the packages named\\n“paintutils” and “drawing”, you would use the command:\\njava -ea:paintutils... -ea:drawing... MegaPaint\\nIf you are using the Eclipse integrated development environ ment, you can specify the -ea\\noption by creating a run conﬁguration . Right-click the name of the main program class in the\\nPackage Explorer pane, and select “Run As” from the pop-up me nu and then “Run. . . ” from\\nthe submenu. This will open a dialog box where you can manage r un conﬁgurations. The name\\nof the project and of the main class will be already be ﬁlled in . Click the “Arguments” tab, and\\nenter -ea in the box under “VM Arguments”. The contents of this box are a dded to the java\\ncommand that is used to run the program. Y ou can enter other op tions in this box, including\\nmore complicated enableassertions options such as -ea:paintutils.... When you click the\\n“Run” button, the options will be applied. F urthermore, the y will be applied whenever you run\\nthe program, unless you change the run conﬁguration or add a n ew conﬁguration. Note that it\\nis possible to make two run conﬁgurations for the same class, one with assertions enabled and\\none with assertions disabled.\\n8.5 Introduction to Threads\\nLike people, computers can multitask.

T o use the full power of these multip rocessing computers, a programmer\\nmust do parallel programming , which means writing a program as a set of several tasks that\\ncan be executed simultaneously . Even on a single-processor computer, parallel programming\\ntechniques can be useful, since some problems can be tackled most naturally by breaking the\\nsolution into a set of simultaneous tasks that cooperate to s olve the problem.\\nIn Java, a single task is called a thread. The term “thread” refers to a “thread of control” or\\n“thread of execution,” meaning a sequence of instructions t hat are executed one after another—\\nthe thread extends through time, connecting each instructi on to the next. In a multithreaded\\nprogram, there can be many threads of control, weaving throu gh time in parallel and forming\\nthe complete fabric of the program. (Ok, enough with the meta phor, already!) Every Java\\nprogram has at least one thread; when the Java virtual machin e runs your program, it creates a\\nthread that is responsible for executing the main routine of the program. This main thread can\\nin turn create other threads that can continue even after the main thread has terminated. In a\\nGUI program, there is at least one additional thread, which i s responsible for handling events\\nand drawing components on the screen. This GUI thread is crea ted when the ﬁrst window is\\nopened. So in fact, you have already done parallel programmi ng! When a main routine opens a\\nwindow, both the main thread and the GUI thread can continue t o run in parallel. Of course,\\nparallel programming can be used in much more interesting wa ys.\\nUnfortunately , parallel programming is even more diﬃcult t han ordinary , single-threaded\\nprogramming. When several threads are working together on a problem, a whole new category\\nof errors is possible. This just means that techniques for wr iting correct and robust programs are\\neven more important for parallel programming than they are f or normal programming. (That’s\\none excuse for having this section in this chapter—another i s that we will need threads at several\\npoints in future chapters, and I didn’t have another place in the book where the topic ﬁts more\\nnaturally .) Since threads are a diﬃcult topic, you will prob ably not fully understand everything\\nin this section the ﬁrst time through the material. Y our unde rstanding should improve as you\\nencounter more examples of threads in future sections.\\n8.5.1 Creating and Running Threads\\nIn Java, a thread is represented by an object belonging to the class java.lang.Thread (or to\\na subclass of this class). The purpose of a Thread object is to execute a single method. The\\nmethod is executed in its own thread of control, which can run in parallel with other threads.\\nWhen the execution of the method is ﬁnished, either because t he method terminates normally\\nor because of an uncaught exception, the thread stops runnin g. Once this happens, there is no\\nway to restart the thread or to use the same Thread object to start another thread.\\nThere are two ways to program a thread. One is to create a subcl ass of Thread and to deﬁne\\nthe method public void run() in the subclass. This run() method deﬁnes the task that will\\nbe performed by the thread; that is, when the thread is starte d, it is the run() method that\\nwill be executed in the thread. F or example, here is a simple, and rather useless, class that\\ndeﬁnes a thread that does nothing but print a message on stand ard output:\\npublic class NamedThread extends Thread {\\nprivate String name; // The name of this thread.\\npublic NamedThread(String name) { // Constructor gives nam e to thread.\\nthis.name = name;\\n}\\npublic void run() { // The run method prints a message to stand ard output.'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO THREADS 401\\nSystem.out.println(\"Greetings from thread ’\" + name + \"’!\");\\n}\\n}\\nT o use a NamedThread, you must of course create an object belonging to this class. F or\\nexample,\\nNamedThread greetings = new NamedThread(\"Fred\");\\nHowever, creating the object does not automatically start t he thread running. T o do that, you\\nmust call the start() method in the thread object. F or the example, this would be do ne with\\nthe statement\\ngreetings.start();\\nThe purpose of the start() method is to create a new thread of control that will execute t he\\nThread object’s run() method. The new thread runs in parallel with the thread in whi ch the\\nstart() method was called, along with any other threads that already existed. This means\\nthat the code in the run() method will execute at the same time as the statements that fo llow\\nthe call to greetings.start(). Consider this code segment:\\nNamedThread greetings = new NamedThread(\"Fred\");\\ngreetings.start();\\nSystem.out.println(\"Thread has been started.\");\\nAfter greetings.start() is executed, there are two threads. One of them will print “Th read\\nhas been started.” while the other one wants to print “Greeti ngs from thread ’F red’ !”. It is\\nimportant to note that these messages can be printed in either order . The two threads run\\nsimultaneously and will compete for access to standard outp ut, so that they can print their\\nmessages. Whichever thread happens to be the ﬁrst to get acce ss will be the ﬁrst to print its\\nmessage. In a normal, single-threaded program, things happ en in a deﬁnite, predictable order\\nfrom beginning to end. In a multi-threaded program, there is a fundamental indeterminancy .\\nY ou can’t be sure what order things will happen in. This indet erminacy is what makes parallel\\nprogramming so diﬃcult!\\nNote that calling greetings.start() is very diﬀerent from calling greetings.run().\\nCalling greetings.run() will execute the run() method in the same thread, rather than\\ncreating a new thread. This means that all the work of the run() will be done before the\\ncomputer moves on to the statement that follows the call to greetings.run() in the program.\\nThere is no parallelism and no indeterminacy .\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nI mentioned that there are two ways to program a thread. The ﬁr st way was to de-\\nﬁne a subclass of Thread. The second is to deﬁne a class that implements the interface\\njava.lang.Runnable. The Runnable interface deﬁnes a single method, public void run().\\nAn object that implements the Runnable interface can be passed as a parameter to the con-\\nstructor of an object of type Thread.

When I ran it using six threads, the output was:\\nCreating 6 prime counting threads...\\nThreads have been created and started.\\nThread 1 counted 78498 primes in 6.706 seconds.\\nThread 4 counted 78498 primes in 6.693 seconds.\\nThread 0 counted 78498 primes in 6.838 seconds.\\nThread 2 counted 78498 primes in 6.825 seconds.\\nThread 3 counted 78498 primes in 6.893 seconds.\\nThread 5 counted 78498 primes in 6.859 seconds.\\nThe second line was printed immediately after the ﬁrst. At th is point, the main program\\nhas ended but the six threads continue to run. After a pause of about seven seconds, all six\\nthreads completed at about the same time. The order in which t he threads complete is not the\\nsame as the order in which they were started, and the order is i ndeterminate. That is, if the\\nprogram is run again, the order in which the threads complete will probably be diﬀerent.\\nOn my computer, six threads take about six times longer than o ne thread. This is because\\nmy computer has only one processor. Six threads, all doing th e same task, take six times as\\nmuch processing as one thread. With only one processor to do t he work, the total elapsed time\\nfor six threads is about six times longer than the time for one thread. On a computer with\\ntwo processors, the computer can work on two tasks at the same time, and six threads might\\ncomplete in as little as three times the time it takes for one t hread. On a computer with six or\\nmore processors, six threads might take no more time than a si ngle thread.

What happens when you run\\nthe program on your own computer? How many processors do you h ave?\\nWhenever there are more threads to be run than there are proce ssors to run them, the\\ncomputer divides its attention among all the runnable threa ds by switching rapidly from one\\nthread to another. That is, each processor runs one thread fo r a while then switches to another\\nthread and runs that one for a while, and so on.

This\\nis why in the sample program, in which each thread has the same amount of work to do, all\\nthe threads complete at about the same time: Over any time per iod longer than a fraction of\\na second, the computer’s time is divided approximately equa lly among all the threads.\\nWhen you do parallel programming in order to spread the work a mong several processors,\\nyou might want to take into account the number of available pr ocessors. Y ou might, for example,\\nwant to create one thread for each processor. In Java, you can ﬁnd out the number of processors\\nby calling the function\\nRuntime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()\\nwhich returns an int giving the number of processors that are available to the Jav a Virtual\\nMachine. In some cases, this might be less than the actual num ber of processors in the computer.\\n8.5.2 Operations on Threads\\nThe Thread class includes several useful methods in addition to the start() method that was\\ndiscussed above. I will mention just a few of them.\\nIf thrd is an object of type Thread, then the boolean-valued function thrd.isAlive() can\\nbe used to test whether or not the thread is alive. A thread is “ alive” between the time it\\nis started and the time when it terminates. After the thread h as terminated it is said to be\\n“dead”. (The rather gruesome metaphor is also used when we re fer to “killing” or “aborting”\\na thread.)\\nThe static method Thread.sleep(milliseconds) causes the thread that executes this\\nmethod to “sleep” for the speciﬁed number of milliseconds. A sleeping thread is still alive,\\nbut it is not running. While a thread is sleeping, the compute r will work on any other runnable\\nthreads (or on other programs). Thread.sleep() can be used to insert a pause in the execution\\nof a thread. The sleep method can throw an exception of type InterruptedException, which\\nis an exception class that requires mandatory exception han dling (see Subsection 8.3.4). In\\npractice, this means that the sleep method is usually used in a try..catch statement that\\ncatches the potential InterruptedException:\\ntry {\\nThread.sleep(lengthOfPause);\\n}\\ncatch (InterruptedException e) {\\n}\\nOne thread can interrupt another thread to wake it up when it i s sleeping or paused for some\\nother reason. A Thread, thrd, can be interrupted by calling its method thrd.interrupt(),\\nbut you are not likely to do this until you start writing rathe r advanced applications, and you\\nare not likely to need to do anything in response to an InterruptedException (except to catch\\nit). It’s unfortunate that you have to worry about it at all, b ut that’s the way that mandatory\\nexception handling works.\\nSometimes, it’s necessary for one thread to wait for anther t hread to die. This is done\\nwith the join() method from the Thread class. Suppose that thrd is a Thread. Then,\\nif another thread calls thrd.join(), that other thread will go to sleep until thrd termi-\\nnates. If thrd is already dead when thrd.join() is called, then it simply has no eﬀect—\\nthe thread that called thrd.join() proceeds immediately . The method join() can throw an\\nInterruptedException, which must be handled. As an example, the following code sta rts\\nseveral threads, waits for them all to terminate, and then ou tputs the elapsed time:'),\n",

The real diﬃculty arises\\nwhen threads have to interact in some way . One way that thread s interact is by sharing\\nresources. When two threads need access to the same resource , such as a variable or a window\\non the screen, some care must be taken that they don’t try to us e the same resource at the same\\ntime. Otherwise, the situation could be something like this : Imagine several cooks sharing the\\nuse of just one measuring cup, and imagine that Cook A ﬁlls the measuring cup with milk, only\\nto have Cook B grab the cup before Cook A has a chance to empty th e milk into his bowl.\\nThere has to be some way for Cook A to claim exclusive rights to the cup while he performs\\nthe two operations: Add-Milk-T o-Cup and Empty-Cup-Into-B owl.\\nSomething similar happens with threads, even with somethin g as simple as adding one to a\\ncounter. The statement\\ncount = count + 1;\\nis actually a sequence of three operations:\\nStep 1. Get the value of count\\nStep 2. Add 1 to the value.\\nStep 3. Store the new value in count'),\n",

CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS\\nSuppose that several threads perform these three steps. Rem ember that it’s possible for two\\nthreads to run at the same time, and even if there is only one pr ocessor, it’s possible for that\\nprocessor to switch from one thread to another at any point. S uppose that while one thread is\\nbetween Step 2 and Step 3, another thread starts executing th e same sequence of steps. Since\\nthe ﬁrst thread has not yet stored the new value in count, the second thread reads the old value\\nof count and adds one to that old value. After both threads have execut ed Step 3, the value of\\ncount has gone up only by 1 instead of by 2! This type of problem is cal led a race condition .\\nThis occurs when one thread is in the middle of a multi-step op eration, and another thread\\nchanges some value or condition that the ﬁrst thread is depen ding upon. (The ﬁrst thread is “in\\na race” to complete all the steps before it is interrupted by a nother thread.) Another example\\nof a race condition can occur in an if statement. Suppose the following statement, which is\\nmeant to avoid a division-by-zero error is executed by a thre ad:\\nif ( A != 0 )\\nB = C / A;\\nIf the variable A is shared by several threads, and if nothing is done to guard a gainst the race\\ncondition, then it is possible that a second thread will chan ge the value of A to zero between the\\ntime that the ﬁrst thread checks the condition A != 0 and the time that it does the division.\\nThis means that the thread ends up dividing by zero, even thou gh it just checked that A was\\nnot zero!\\nT o ﬁx the problem of race conditions, there has to be some way f or a thread to get exclusive\\naccess to a shared resource. This is not a trivial thing to implement , but Java provides a high\\nlevel and relatively easy-to-use approach to exclusive acc ess. It’s done with synchronized\\nmethods and with the synchronized statement . These are used to protect shared resources\\nby making sure that only one thread at a time will try to access the resource. Synchronization in\\nJava actually provides only mutual exclusion , which means that exclusive access to a resource\\nis only guaranteed if every thread that needs access to that resource uses synchronizat ion.\\nSynchronization is like a cook leaving a note that says, “I’m using the measuring cup.” This\\nwill get the cook exclusive access to the cup—but only if all t he cooks agree to check the note\\nbefore trying to grab the cup.\\nBecause this is a diﬃcult topic, I will start with a simple exa mple. Suppose that we want\\nto avoid the race condition that occurs when several threads all want to add 1 to a counter.\\nW e can do this by deﬁning a class to represent the counter and b y using synchronized methods\\nin that class:\\npublic class ThreadSafeCounter {\\nprivate int count = 0; // The value of the counter.\\nsynchronized public void increment() {\\ncount = count + 1;\\n}\\nsynchronized public int getValue() {\\nreturn count;\\n}\\n}\\nIf tsc is of type ThreadSafeCounter, then any thread can call tsc.increment() to add 1 to\\nthe counter in a completely safe way . The fact that tsc.increment() is synchronized means\\nthat only one thread can be in this method at a time; once a thre ad starts executing this'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO THREADS 407\\nmethod, it is guaranteed that it will ﬁnish executing it with out having another thread change\\nthe value of tsc.count in the meantime. There is no possibility of a race condition. Note that\\nthe guarantee depends on the fact that count is a private variable. This forces all access to\\ntsc.count to occur in the synchronized methods that are provided by the class. If count were\\npublic, it would be possible for a thread to bypass the synchronizat ion by , for example, saying\\ntsc.count++. This could change the value of count while another thread is in the middle of\\nthe tsc.increment(). Synchronization does not guarantee exclusive access; it only guarantees\\nmutual exclusion among all the threads that are properly synchronized.\\nThe ThreadSafeCounter class does not prevent all possible race conditions that mig ht arise\\nwhen using a counter. Consider the if statement:\\nif ( tsc.getValue() == 0 )\\ndoSomething();\\nwhere doSomething() is some method that requires the value of the counter to be zer o. There\\nis still a race condition here, which occurs if a second threa d increments the counter between\\nthe time the ﬁrst thread tests tsc.getValue() == 0 and the time it executes doSomething().\\nThe ﬁrst thread needs exclusive access to the counter during the execution of the whole if\\nstatement. (The synchronization in the ThreadSafeCounter class only gives it exclusive access\\nduring the time it is evaluating tsc.getValue().) W e can solve the race condition by putting\\nthe if statement in a synchronized statement:\\nsynchronized(tsc) {\\nif ( tsc.getValue() == 0 )\\ndoSomething();\\n}\\nNote that the synchronized statement takes an object— tsc in this case—as a kind of param-\\neter. The syntax of the synchronized statement is:\\nsynchronized( ⟨object ⟩ ) {\\n⟨statements ⟩\\n}\\nIn Java, mutual exclusion is always associated with an objec t; we say that the synchroniza-\\ntion is “on” that object. F or example, the if statement above is “synchronized on tsc.” A\\nsynchronized instance method, such as those in the class ThreadSafeCounter, is synchronized\\non the object that contains the instance method. In fact, add ing the synchronized modiﬁer\\nto the deﬁnition of an instance method is pretty much equival ent to putting the body of the\\nmethod in a synchronized statement, synchronized(this) {...}. It is also possible to have\\nsynchronized static methods; a synchronized static method is synchronized on a special class\\nobject that represents the class that contains the static me thod.\\nThe real rule of synchronization in Java is: Two threads cannot be synchronized on\\nthe same object at the same time ; that is, they cannot simultaneously be executing code\\nsegments that are synchronized on that object. If one thread is synchronized on an object, and\\na second thread tries to synchronize on the same object, the s econd thread is forced to wait\\nuntil the ﬁrst thread has ﬁnished with the object. This is imp lemented using something called\\na lock. Every object has a lock, and that lock can be “held” by only on e thread at a time. T o\\nenter a synchronized statement or synchronized method, a th read must obtain the associated\\nobject’s lock. If the lock is available, then the thread obta ins the lock and immediately begins\\nexecuting the synchronized code. It releases the lock after it ﬁnishes executing the synchronized\\ncode. If Thread A tries to obtain a lock that is already held by Thread B, then Thread A has'),\n",

CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS\\nto wait until Thread B releases the lock. In fact, Thread A wil l go to sleep, and will not be\\nawoken until the lock becomes available.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nAs a simple example of shared resources, we return to the prim e-counting problem. Suppose\\nthat we want to count all the primes in a given range of integer s, and suppose that we want\\nto divide the work up among several threads. Each thread will be assigned part of the range\\nof integers and will count the primes in its assigned range. A t the end of its computation, the\\nthread has to add its count to the overall total number of prim es found. The variable that\\nrepresents the total is shared by all the threads. If each thr ead just says\\ntotal = total + count;\\nthen there is a (small) chance that two threads will try to do t his at the same time and that the\\nﬁnal total will be wrong. T o prevent this race condition, acc ess to total has to be synchronized.\\nMy program uses a synchronized method to add the counts to the total:\\nsynchronized private static void addToTotal(int x) {\\ntotal = total + x;\\nSystem.out.println(total + \" primes found so far.\");\\n}\\nThe source code for the program can be found in ThreadTest2.java. This program counts\\nthe primes in the range 3000001 to 6000000. (The numbers are r ather arbitrary .) The main()\\nroutine in this program creates between 1 and 5 threads and as signs part of the job to each\\nthread. It then waits for all the threads to ﬁnish, using the join() method as described above,\\nand reports the total elapsed time. If you run the program on a multiprocessor computer, it\\nshould take less time for the program to run when you use more t han one thread. Y ou can\\ncompile and run the program or try the equivalent applet in th e on-line version of this section.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nSynchronization can help to prevent race conditions, but it introduces the possibility of\\nanother type of error, deadlock. A deadlock occurs when a thread waits forever for a resource\\nthat it will never get. In the kitchen, a deadlock might occur if two very simple-minded cooks\\nboth want to measure a cup of milk at the same time. The ﬁrst coo k grabs the measuring cup,\\nwhile the second cook grabs the milk. The ﬁrst cook needs the m ilk, but can’t ﬁnd it because\\nthe second cook has it. The second cook needs the measuring cu p, but can’t ﬁnd it because\\nthe ﬁrst cook has it. Neither cook can continue and nothing mo re gets done. This is deadlock.\\nExactly the same thing can happen in a program, for example if there are two threads (like the\\ntwo cooks) both of which need to obtain locks on the same two ob jects (like the milk and the\\nmeasuring cup) before they can proceed. Deadlocks can easil y occur, unless great care is taken\\nto avoid them. F ortunately , we won’t be looking at any exampl es that require locks on more\\nthan one object, so we will avoid that source of deadlock.\\n8.5.4 Wait and Notify\\nThreads can interact with each other in other ways besides sh aring resources. F or example,\\none thread might produce some sort of result that is needed by another thread. This imposes\\nsome restriction on the order in which the threads can do thei r computations. If the second\\nthread gets to the point where it needs the result from the ﬁrs t thread, it might have to stop\\nand wait for the result to be produced. Since the second threa d can’t continue, it might as well\\ngo to sleep. But then there has to be some way to notify the seco nd thread when the result is'),\n",

INTRODUCTION TO THREADS 409\\nready , so that it can wake up and continue its computation. Ja va, of course, has a way to do\\nthis kind of waiting and notiﬁcation: It has wait() and notify() methods that are deﬁned as\\ninstance methods in class Object and so can be used with any object. The reason why wait()\\nand notify() should be associated with objects is not obvious, so don’t wo rry about it at this\\npoint. It does, at least, make it possible to direct diﬀerent notiﬁcations to a diﬀerent recipients,\\ndepending on which object’s notify() method is called.\\nThe general idea is that when a thread calls a wait() method in some object, that thread\\ngoes to sleep until the notify() method in the same object is called. It will have to be called,\\nobviously , by another thread, since the thread that called wait() is sleeping. A typical pattern\\nis that Thread A calls wait() when it needs a result from Thread B, but that result is not yet\\navailable. When Thread B has the result ready , it calls notify(), which will wake Thread A\\nup so that it can use the result. It is not an error to call notify() when no one is waiting;\\nit just has no eﬀect. T o implement this, Thread A will execute code simlar to the following,\\nwhere obj is some object:\\nif ( resultIsAvailable() == false )\\nobj.wait(); // wait for noification that the result is avail able\\nuseTheResult();\\nwhile Thread B does something like:\\ngenerateTheResult();\\nobj.notify(); // send out a notification that the result is a vailable\\nNow, there is a really nasty race condition in this code. The t wo threads might execute\\ntheir code in the following order:\\n1. Thread A checks resultIsAvailable() and finds that the re sult is not ready,\\nso it decides to execute the obj.wait() statement, but before it does,\\n2. Thread B finishes generating the result and calls obj.not ify()\\n3. Thread A calls obj.wait() to wait for notification that th e result is ready.\\nIn Step 3, Thread A is waiting for a notiﬁcation that will neve r come, because notify()\\nhas already been called. This is a kind of deadlock that can le ave Thread A waiting forever.\\nObviously , we need some kind of synchronization. The soluti on is to enclose both Thread A’s\\ncode and Thread B’s code in synchronized statements, and it is very natural to synchronize\\non the same object, obj, that is used for the calls to wait() and notify(). In fact, since\\nsynchronization is almost always needed when wait() and notify() are used, Java makes it\\nan absolute requirement. In Java, a thread can legally call obj.wait() or obj.notify() only\\nif that thread holds the synchronization lock associated wi th the object obj. If it does not hold\\nthat lock, then an exception is thrown. (The exception is of t ype IllegalMonitorStateException,\\nwhich does not require mandatory handling and which is typic ally not caught.) One further\\ncomplication is that the wait() method can throw an InterruptedException and so should be\\ncalled in a try statement that handles the exception.\\nT o make things more deﬁnite, lets consider a producer/consumer problem where one\\nthread produces a result that is consumed by another thread. Assume that there is a shared\\nvariable named sharedResult that is used to transfer the result from the producer to the\\nconsumer. When the result is ready , the producer sets the var iable to a non-null value. The\\nproducer can check whether the result is ready by testing whe ther the value of sharedResult\\nis null. W e will use a variable named lock for synchronization. The the code for the producer\\nthread could have the form:'),\n",

In fact, lock.wait() is a special case: When the\\nconsumer thread calls lock.wait(), it gives up the lock that it holds on the synchronization\\nobject, lock.

Consumer t hreads remove objects from this\\nlist. The only time when a thread is blocked from running is wh en a consumer thread tries\\nto get a result from the list, and no results are available.

If we look at the ﬂow of customer orders int o the kitchen, the waiters\\n“produce” the orders and leave them in a pile. The orders are “ consumed” by the cooks;\\nwhenever a cook needs a new order to work on, she picks one up fr om the pile. The pile of\\norders, or course, plays the role of the list of result object s in the producer/consumer pattern.\\nNote that the only time that a cook has to wait is when she needs a new order to work on, and\\nthere are no orders in the pile. The cook must wait until one of the waiters places an order in\\nthe pile. W e can complete the analogy by imagining that the wa iter rings a bell when he places\\nthe order in the pile—ringing the bell is like calling the notify() method to notify the cooks\\nthat an order is available.\\nA ﬁnal note on notify: It is possible for several threads to be waiting for notiﬁca tion. A call\\nto obj.notify() will wake only one of the threads that is waiting on obj. If you want to wake\\nall threads that are waiting on obj, you can call obj.notifyAll(). And a ﬁnal note on wait:\\nThere is an another version of wait() that takes a number of milliseconds as a parameter.\\nA thread that calls obj.wait(milliseconds) will wait only up to the speciﬁed number of\\nmilliseconds for a notiﬁcation. If a notiﬁcation doesn’t oc cur during that period, the thread\\nwill wake up and continue without the notiﬁcation. In practi ce, this feature is most often used\\nto let a waiting thread wake periodically while it is waiting in order to perform some periodic\\ntask, such as causing a message “W aiting for computation to ﬁ nish” to blink.'),\n",

CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS\\n8.5.5 Volatile Variables\\nAnd a ﬁnal note on communication among threads: In general, t hreads communicate by sharing\\nvariables and accessing those variables in synchronized me thods or synchronized statements.\\nHowever, synchronization is fairly expensive computation ally , and excessive use of it should be\\navoided. So in some cases, it can make sense for threads to ref er to shared variables without\\nsynchronizing their access to those variables.\\nHowever, a subtle problem arises when the value of a shared va riable is set is one thread\\nand used in another. Because of the way that threads are imple mented in Java, the second\\nthread might not see the changed value of the variable immedi ately . That is, it is possible that\\na thread will continue to see the old value of the shared variable for some time after the value\\nof the variable has been changed by another thread. This is be cause threads are allowed to\\ncache shared data. That is, each thread can keep its own local copy o f the shared data. When\\none thread changes the value of a shared variable, the local c opies in the caches of other threads\\nare not immediately changed, so the other threads continue t o see the old value.\\nWhen a synchronized method or statement is entered, threads are forced to update their\\ncaches to the most current values of the variables in the cach e. So, using shared variables in\\nsynchronized code is always safe.\\nIt is still possible to use a shared variable outside of synchronized code, but in that case,\\nthe variable must be declared to be volatile. The volatile keyword is a modiﬁer that can be\\nadded to a variable declaration, as in\\nprivate volatile int count;\\nIf a variable is declared to be volatile, no thread will keep a local copy of that variable in its\\ncache. Instead, the thread will always use the oﬃcial, main c opy of the variable. This means\\nthat any change made to the variable will immediately be avai lable to all threads. This makes\\nit safe for threads to refer to volatile shared variables even outside of synchronized code.\\n(Remember, though, that synchronization is still the only w ay to prevent race conditions.)\\nWhen the volatile modiﬁer is applied to an object variable, only the variable i tself is\\ndeclared to be volatile, not the contents of the object that t he variable points to. F or this\\nreason, volatile is generally only used for variables of simple types such as p rimitive types\\nand enumerated types.\\nA typical example of using volatile variables is to send a sig nal from one thread to another\\nthat tells the second thread to terminate. The two threads wo uld share a variable\\nvolatile boolean terminate = false;\\nThe run method of the second thread would check the value of terminate frequently and end\\nwhen the value of terminate becomes true:\\npublic void run() {\\nwhile (true) {\\nif (terminate)\\nreturn;\\n.\\n. // Do some work\\n.\\n}\\n}\\nThis thread will run until some other thread sets the value of terminate to true. Something\\nlike this is really the only clean way for one thread to cause a nother thread to die.'),\n",

ANAL YSIS OF ALGORITHMS 413\\n(By the way , you might be wondering why threads should use loc al data caches in the ﬁrst\\nplace, since it seems to complicate things unnecessarily . C aching is allowed because of the\\nstructure of multiprocessing computers. In many multiproc essing computers, each processor\\nhas some local memory that is directly connected to the proce ssor. A thread’s cache is stored\\nin the local memory of the processor on which the thread is run ning. Access to this local\\nmemory is much faster than access to other memory , so it is mor e eﬃcient for a thread to use\\na local copy of a shared variable rather than some “master cop y” that is stored in non-local\\nmemory .)\\n8.6 Analysis of Algorithms\\nThis chapter has concentrated mostly on correctness of programs. In practice, another\\nissue is also important: eﬃciency . When analyzing a program in terms of eﬃciency , we\\nwant to look at questions such as, “How long does it take for th e program to run?” and “Is\\nthere another approach that will get the answer more quickly ?” Eﬃciency will always be less\\nimportant than correctness; if you don’t care whether a prog ram works correctly , you can make\\nit run very quickly indeed, but no one will think it’s much of a n achievement! On the other\\nhand, a program that gives a correct answer after ten thousan d years isn’t very useful either,\\nso eﬃciency is often an important issue.\\nThe term “eﬃciency” can refer to eﬃcient use of almost any res ource, including time,\\ncomputer memory , disk space, or network bandwidth. In this s ection, however, we will deal\\nexclusively with time eﬃciency , and the major question that we want to ask about a program\\nis, how long does it take to perform its task?\\nIt really makes little sense to classify an individual progr am as being “eﬃcient” or “ineﬃ-\\ncient.” It makes more sense to compare two (correct) program s that perform the same task and\\nask which one of the two is “more eﬃcient,” that is, which one p erforms the task more quickly .\\nHowever, even here there are diﬃculties. The running time of a program is not well-deﬁned.\\nThe run time can be diﬀerent depending on the number and speed of the processors in the\\ncomputer on which it is run and, in the case of Java, on the desi gn of the Java Virtual Machine\\nwhich is used to interpret the program. It can depend on detai ls of the compiler which is used\\nto translate the program from high-level language to machin e language. F urthermore, the run\\ntime of a program depends on the size of the problem which the p rogram has to solve. It takes\\na sorting program longer to sort 10000 items than it takes it t o sort 100 items. When the run\\ntimes of two programs are compared, it often happens that Pro gram A solves small problems\\nfaster than Program B, while Program B solves large problems faster than Program A, so that\\nit is simply not the case that one program is faster than the ot her in all cases.\\nIn spite of these diﬃculties, there is a ﬁeld of computer scie nce dedicated to analyzing\\nthe eﬃciency of programs. The ﬁeld is known as Analysis of Algorithms . The focus is\\non algorithms, rather than on programs as such, to avoid havi ng to deal with multiple im-\\nplementations of the same algorithm written in diﬀerent lan guages, compiled with diﬀerent\\ncompilers, and running on diﬀerent computers. Analysis of A lgorithms is a mathematical ﬁeld\\nthat abstracts away from these down-and-dirty details. Sti ll, even though it is a theoretical\\nﬁeld, every working programmer should be aware of some of its techniques and results. This\\nsection is a very brief introduction to some of those techniq ues and results. Because this is not\\na mathematics book, the treatment will be rather informal.\\nOne of the main techniques of analysis of algorithms is asymptotic analysis . The term\\n“asymptotic” here means basically “the tendency in the long run.” An asymptotic analysis of'),\n",

CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS\\nan algorithm’s run time looks at the question of how the run ti me depends on the size of the\\nproblem. The analysis is asymptotic because it only conside rs what happens to the run time\\nas the size of the problem increases without limit; it is not c oncerned with what happens for\\nproblems of small size or, in fact, for problems of any ﬁxed ﬁn ite size. Only what happens in the\\nlong run, as the problem size increases without limit, is imp ortant. Showing that Algorithm A\\nis asymptotically faster than Algorithm B doesn’t necessar ily mean that Algorithm A will run\\nfaster than Algorithm B for problems of size 10 or size 1000 or even size 1000000—it only\\nmeans that if you keep increasing the problem size, you will e ventually come to a point where\\nAlgorithm A is faster than Algorithm B. An asymptotic analys is is only a ﬁrst approximation,\\nbut in practice it often gives important and useful informat ion.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nCentral to asymptotic analysis is Big-Oh notation . Using this notation, we might say ,\\nfor example, that an algorithm has a running time that is O(n2) or O(n) or O(log(n)). These\\nnotations are read “Big-Oh of n squared,” “Big-Oh of n,” and “ Big-Oh of log n” (where log is a\\nlogarithm function). More generally , we can refer to O(f(n)) (“Big-Oh of f of n”), where f(n) is\\nsome function that assigns a positive real number to every po sitive integer n. The “n” in this\\nnotation refers to the size of the problem. Before you can eve n begin an asymptotic analysis,\\nyou need some way to measure problem size. Usually , this is no t a big issue. F or example, if\\nthe problem is to sort a list of items, then the problem size ca n be taken to be the number of\\nitems in the list. When the input to an algorithm is an integer , as in the case of algorithm that\\nchecks whether a given positive integer is prime, the usual m easure of the size of a problem\\nis the number of bits in the input integer rather than the inte ger itself. More generally , the\\nnumber of bits in the input to a problem is often a good measure of the size of the problem.\\nT o say that the running time of an algorithm is O(f(n)) means that for large values of\\nthe problem size, n, the running time of the algorithm is no bi gger than some constant times\\nf(n). (More rigorously , there is a number C and a positive int eger M such that whenever n\\nis greater than M, the run time is less than or equal to C*f(n). ) The constant takes into\\naccount details such as the speed of the computer on which the algorithm is run; if you use\\na slower computer, you might have to use a bigger constant in t he formula, but changing the\\nconstant won’t change the basic fact that the run time is O(f(n)). The constant also makes\\nit unnecessary to say whether we are measuring time in second s, years, CPU cycles, or any\\nother unit of measure; a change from one unit of measure to ano ther is just multiplication by\\na constant. Note also that O(f(n)) doesn’t depend at all on what happens for small proble m\\nsizes, only on what happens in the long run as the problem size increases without limit.\\nT o look at a simple example, consider the problem of adding up all the numbers in an array .\\nThe problem size, n, is the length of the array . Using A as the name of the array , the algorithm\\ncan be expressed in Java as:\\ntotal = 0;\\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\\ntotal = total + A[i];\\nThis algorithm performs the same operation, total = total + A[i], n times. The total\\ntime spent on this operation is a*n, where a is the time it take s to perform the operation once.\\nNow, this is not the only thing that is done in the algorithm. T he value of i is incremented\\nand is compared to n each time through the loop. This adds an ad ditional time of b*n to the\\nrun time, for some constant b. F urthermore, i and total both have to be initialized to zero;\\nthis adds some constant amount c to the running time. The exac t running time would then be\\n(a+b)*n+c, where the constants a, b, and c depend on factors s uch as how the code is compiled'),\n",

ANAL YSIS OF ALGORITHMS 415\\nand what computer it is run on. Using the fact that c is less tha n or equal to c*n for any\\npositive integer n, we can say that the run time is less than or equal to (a+b+c)*n. That is,\\nthe run time is less than or equal to a constant times n. By deﬁn ition, this means that the run\\ntime for this algorithm is O(n).\\nIf this explanation is too mathematical for you, we can just n ote that for large values of\\nn, the c in the formula (a+b)*n+c is insigniﬁcant compared to the other term, (a+b)*n. W e\\nsay that c is a “lower order term.” When doing asymptotic anal ysis, lower order terms can\\nbe discarded. A rough, but correct, asymptotic analysis of t he algorithm would go something\\nlike this: Each iteration of the for loop takes a certain constant amount of time. There are\\nn iterations of the loop, so the total run time is a constant ti mes n, plus lower order terms\\n(to account for the initialization). Disregarding lower or der terms, we see that the run time is\\nO(n).\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nNote that to say that an algorithm has run time O(f(n)) is to say that its run time is no\\nbigger than some constant times n (for large values of n). O(f(n)) puts an upper limit on the\\nrun time. However, the run time could be smaller, even much sm aller. F or example, if the run\\ntime is O(n), it would also be correct to say that the run time is O(n2) or even O(n10). If the\\nrun time is less than a constant times n, then it is certainly l ess than the same constant times\\nn2 or n 10.\\nOf course, sometimes it’s useful to have a lower limit on the run time. That is, we want to\\nbe able to say that the run time is greater than or equal to some constant times f(n) (for large\\nvalues of n). The notation for this is Ω(f(n)), read “Omega of f of n.” “Omega” is the name of\\na letter in the Greek alphabet, and Ω is the upper case version of that letter. (T o be technical,\\nsaying that the run time of an algorithm is Ω(f(n)) means that there is a positive number C\\nand a positive integer M such that whenever n is greater than M , the run time is greater than\\nor equal to C*f(n).) O(f(n)) tells you something about the maximum amount of time t hat you\\nmight have to wait for an algorithm to ﬁnish; Ω(f(n)) tells yo u something about the minimum\\ntime.\\nThe algorithm for adding up the numbers in an array has a run ti me that is Ω(n) as well as\\nO(n). When an algorithm has a run time that is both Ω(f(n)) and O(f(n)), its run time is said\\nto be Θ(f(n)), read “Theta of f of n.” (Theta is another letter from the Greek alphabet.) T o\\nsay that the run time of an algorithm is Θ(f(n)) means that for large values of n, the run time\\nis between a*f(n) and b*f(n), where a and b are constants (wit h b greater than a, and both\\ngreater than 0).\\nLet’s look at another example. Consider the algorithm that c an be expressed in Java in the\\nfollowing method:\\n/**\\n* Sorts the n array elements A[0], A[1], ..., A[n-1] into increasing order.\\n*/\\npublic static simpleBubbleSort( int[] A, int n ) {\\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n// Do n passes through the array...\\nfor (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) {\\nif ( A[j] > A[j+1] ) {\\n// A[j] and A[j+1] are out of order, so swap them\\nint temp = A[j];\\nA[j] = A[j+1];\\nA[j+1] = temp;'),\n",

Each time the outer for loop is executed, the inner for loop is exectued n-1 times, so\\nthe if statement is executed n*(n-1) times. This is n 2-n, but since lower order terms are not\\nsigniﬁcant in an asymptotic analysis, it’s good enough to sa y that the if statement is executed\\nabout n 2 times. In particular, the test A[j] > A[j+1] is executed about n 2 times, and this fact\\nby itself is enough to say that the run time of the algorithm is Ω(n 2), that is, the run time is\\nat least some constant times n 2. F urthermore, if we look at other operations—the assignmen t\\nstatements, incrementing i and j, etc.—none of them are executed more than n 2 times, so the\\nrun time is also O(n2), that is, the run time is no more than some constant times n 2. Since it\\nis both Ω(n 2) and O(n2), the run time of the simpleBubbleSort algorithm is Θ(n 2).\\nY ou should be aware that some people use the notation O(f(n)) as if it meant Θ(f(n)). That\\nis, when they say that the run time of an algorithm is O(f(n)), they mean to say that the run\\ntime is about equal to a constant times f(n). F or that, they should use Θ(f(n)). P roperly\\nspeaking, O(f(n)) means that the run time is less than a constant times f( n), possibly much\\nless.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nSo far, my analysis has ignored an important detail. W e have l ooked at how run time\\ndepends on the problem size, but in fact the run time usually d epends not just on the size of\\nthe problem but on the speciﬁc data that has to be processed. F or example, the run time of a\\nsorting algorithm can depend on the initial order of the item s that are to be sorted, and not\\njust on the number of items.\\nT o account for this dependency , we can consider either the worst case run time analysis\\nor the average case run time analysis of an algorithm. F or a worst case run time an alysis, we\\nconsider all possible problems of size n and look at the longest possible run time for all such\\nproblems. F or an average case analysis, we consider all poss ible problems of size n and look at\\nthe average of the run times for all such problems. Usually , the average c ase analysis assumes\\nthat all problems of size n are equally likely to be encounter ed, although this is not always\\nrealistic—or even possible in the case where there is an inﬁn ite number of diﬀerent problems of\\na given size.\\nIn many cases, the average and the worst case run times are the same to within a constant\\nmultiple. This means that as far as asymptotic analysis is co ncerned, they are the same. That\\nis, if the average case run time is O(f(n)) or Θ(f(n)), then so is the worst case. However, later i n\\nthe book, we will encounter a few cases where the average and w orst case asymptotic analyses\\ndiﬀer.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nSo, what do you really have to know about analysis of algorith ms to read the rest of this\\nbook? W e will not do any rigorous mathematical analysis, but you should be able to follow\\ninformal discussion of simple cases such as the examples tha t we have looked at in this section.\\nMost important, though, you should have a feeling for exactl y what it means to say that the\\nrunning time of an algorithm is O(f(n)) or Θ(f(n)) for some common functions f(n).

ANAL YSIS OF ALGORITHMS 417\\nabout the running time for small values of n. What they do tell you is something about the\\nrate of growth of the running time as the size of the problem increases.\\nSuppose you compare two algorithm that solve the same proble m. The run time of one\\nalgorithm is Θ(n 2), while the run time of the second algorithm is Θ(n 3). What does this tell\\nyou? If you want to know which algorithm will be faster for som e particular problem of size,\\nsay , 100, nothing is certain. As far as you can tell just from t he asymptotic analysis, either\\nalgorithm could be faster for that particular case—or in any particular case. But what you can\\nsay for sure is that if you look at larger and larger problems, you will come to a point where the\\nΘ(n 2) algorithm is faster than the Θ(n 3) algorithm. F urthermore, as you continue to increase\\nthe problem size, the relative advantage of the Θ(n 2) algorithm will continue to grow. There\\nwill be values of n for which the Θ(n 2) algorithm is a thousand times faster, a million times\\nfaster, a billion times faster, and so on. This is because for any positive constants a and b, the\\nfunction a*n 3 grows faster than the function b*n 2 as n gets larger. (Mathematically , the limit\\nof the ratio of a*n 3 to b*n 2 is inﬁnite as n approaches inﬁnity .)\\nThis means that for “large” problems, a Θ(n 2) algorithm will deﬁnitely be faster than a\\nΘ(n 3) algorithm. Y ou just don’t know—based on the asymptotic ana lysis alone—exactly how\\nlarge “large” has to be. In practice, in fact, it is likely tha t the Θ(n 2) algorithm will be faster\\neven for fairly small values of n, and absent other informati on you would generally prefer a\\nΘ(n 2) algorithm to a Θ(n 3) algorithm.\\nSo, to understand and apply asymptotic analysis, it is essen tial to have some idea of the\\nrates of growth of some common functions. F or the power funct ions n, n 2, n 3, n 4, . . . , the larger\\nthe exponent, the greater the rate of growth of the function. Exponential functions such as 2 n\\nand 10 n, where the n is in the exponent, have a growth rate that is fast er than that of any power\\nfunction. In fact, exponential functions grow so quickly th at an algorithm whose run time grows\\nexponentially is almost certainly impractical even for rel atively modest values of n, because the\\nrunning time is just too long. Another function that often tu rns up in asymptotic analysis is\\nthe logarithm function, log(n). There are actually many diﬀ erent logarithm functions, but the\\none that is usually used in computer science is the so-called logarithm to the base two, which is\\ndeﬁned by the fact that log(2 x ) = x for any number x. (Usually , this function is written log 2(n),\\nbut I will leave out the subscript 2, since I will only use the b ase-two logarithm in this book.)\\nThe logarithm function grows very slowly . The growth rate of log(n) is much smaller than the\\ngrowth rate of n. The growth rate of n*log(n) is a little large r than the growth rate of n, but\\nmuch smaller than the growth rate of n 2. The following table should help you understand the\\ndiﬀerences among the rates of grows of various functions:\\n1 6\\n6 4\\n2 5 6\\n1 0 2 4\\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0\\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\\n4\\n6\\n8\\n1 0\\n2 0\\n3 0\\n6 4\\n3 8 4\\n2 0 4 8\\n1 0 2 4 0\\n1 9 9 3 1 5 6 8\\n2 9 8 9 7 3 5 2 8 5 4\\n2 5 6\\n4 0 9 6\\n6 5 5 3 6\\n1 0 4 8 5 7 6\\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\\n4 . 0\\n1 0 . 7\\n3 2 . 0\\n1 0 2 . 4\\n5 0 1 7 3 . 1\\n3 3 4 4 7 7 7 7 . 3\\nn l o g ( n ) n * l o g ( n ) n n / l o g ( n )\\n2\\nThe reason that log(n) shows up so often is because of its asso ciation with multiplying and\\ndividing by two: Suppose you start with the number n and divid e it by 2, then divide by 2\\nagain, and so on, until you get a number that is less than or equ al to 1. Then the number of\\ndivisions is equal (to the nearest integer) to log(n).'),\n",

CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS\\nAs an example, consider the binary search algorithm from Sub section 7.4.1. This algorithm\\nsearches for an item in a sorted array . The problem size, n, ca n be taken to be the length of\\nthe array . Each step in the binary search algorithm divides t he number of items still under\\nconsideration by 2, and the algorithm stops when the number o f items under consideration is\\nless than or equal to 1 (or sooner). It follows that the number of steps for an array of length n\\nis at most log(n). This means that the worst-case run time for binary search is Θ(log(n)). (The\\naverage case run time is also Θ(log(n)).) By comparison, the linear search algorithm, which\\nwas also presented in Subsection 7.4.1 has a run time that is Θ (n). The Θ notation gives us\\na quantitative way to express and to understand the fact that binary search is “much faster”\\nthan linear search.\\nIn binary search, each step of the algorithm divides the prob lem size by 2. It often happens\\nthat some operation in an algorithm (not necessarily a singl e step) divides the problem size\\nby 2. Whenever that happens, the logarithm function is likel y to show up in an asymptotic\\nanalysis of the run time of the algorithm.\\nAnalysis of Algorithms is a large, fascinating ﬁeld. W e will only use a few of the most basic\\nideas from this ﬁeld, but even those can be very helpful for un derstanding the diﬀerences among\\nalgorithms.'),\n",

Both of these te chniques are related to the seemingly\\nparadoxical idea of deﬁning something in terms of itself. Th is turns out to be a remarkably\\npowerful idea.\\nA subroutine is said to be recursive if it calls itself, eithe r directly or indirectly . That is, the\\nsubroutine is used in its own deﬁnition. Recursion can often be used to solve complex problems\\nby reducing them to simpler problems of the same type.\\nA reference to one object can be stored in an instance variabl e of another object. The\\nobjects are then said to be “linked.” Complex data structure s can be built by linking objects\\ntogether. An especially interesting case occurs when an obj ect contains a link to another object\\nthat belongs to the same class. In that case, the class is used in its own deﬁnition. Several\\nimportant types of data structures are built using classes o f this kind.\\n9.1 Recursion\\nAt one time or another , you’ve probably been told that you can’t deﬁne something in\\nterms of itself. Nevertheless, if it’s done right, deﬁning s omething at least partially in terms of\\nitself can be a very powerful technique. A recursive deﬁnition is one that uses the concept\\nor thing that is being deﬁned as part of the deﬁnition. F or exa mple: An “ancestor” is either\\na parent or an ancestor of a parent. A “sentence” can be, among other things, two sentences\\njoined by a conjunction such as “and.” A “directory” is a part of a disk drive that can hold ﬁles\\nand directories. In mathematics, a “set” is a collection of e lements, which can themselves be\\nsets. A “statement” in Java can be a while statement, which is made up of the word “while”,\\na boolean-valued condition, and a statement.\\nRecursive deﬁnitions can describe very complex situations with just a few words. A def-\\ninition of the term “ancestor” without using recursion migh t go something like “a parent, or\\na grandparent, or a great-grandparent, or a great-great-gr andparent, and so on.” But saying\\n“and so on” is not very rigorous. (I’ve often thought that rec ursion is really just a rigorous\\nway of saying “and so on.”) Y ou run into the same problem if you try to deﬁne a “directory”\\nas “a ﬁle that is a list of ﬁles, where some of the ﬁles can be lis ts of ﬁles, where some of those\\nﬁles can be lists of ﬁles, and so on.” T rying to describe what a Java statement can look like,\\nwithout using recursion in the deﬁnition, would be diﬃcult a nd probably pretty comical.\\n427'),\n",

LINKED DA T A STRUCTURES AND RECURSION\\nRecursion can be used as a programming technique. A recursive subroutine is one that\\ncalls itself, either directly or indirectly . T o say that a su broutine calls itself directly means\\nthat its deﬁnition contains a subroutine call statement tha t calls the subroutine that is being\\ndeﬁned. T o say that a subroutine calls itself indirectly mea ns that it calls a second subroutine\\nwhich in turn calls the ﬁrst subroutine (either directly or i ndirectly). A recursive subroutine\\ncan deﬁne a complex task in just a few lines of code. In the rest of this section, we’ll look at a\\nvariety of examples, and we’ll see other examples in the rest of the book.\\n9.1.1 Recursive Binary Search\\nLet’s start with an example that you’ve seen before: the bina ry search algorithm from Subsec-\\ntion 7.4.1. Binary search is used to ﬁnd a speciﬁed value in a s orted list of items (or, if it does\\nnot occur in the list, to determine that fact). The idea is to t est the element in the middle of\\nthe list. If that element is equal to the speciﬁed value, you a re done. If the speciﬁed value is\\nless than the middle element of the list, then you should sear ch for the value in the ﬁrst half of\\nthe list. Otherwise, you should search for the value in the se cond half of the list. The method\\nused to search for the value in the ﬁrst or second half of the li st is binary search. That is, you\\nlook at the middle element in the half of the list that is still under consideration, and either\\nyou’ve found the value you are looking for, or you have to appl y binary search to one half of the\\nremaining elements. And so on! This is a recursive descripti on, and we can write a recursive\\nsubroutine to implement it.\\nBefore we can do that, though, there are two considerations t hat we need to take into\\naccount. Each of these illustrates an important general fac t about recursive subroutines. First\\nof all, the binary search algorithm begins by looking at the “ middle element of the list.” But\\nwhat if the list is empty? If there are no elements in the list, then it is impossible to look\\nat the middle element. In the terminology of Subsection 8.2. 1, having a non-empty list is a\\n“precondition” for looking at the middle element, and this i s a clue that we have to modify\\nthe algorithm to take this precondition into account. What s hould we do if we ﬁnd ourselves\\nsearching for a speciﬁed value in an empty list? The answer is easy: If the list is empty , we can\\nbe sure that the value does not occur in the list, so we can give the answer without any further\\nwork. An empty list is a base case for the binary search algorithm. A base case for a recursive\\nalgorithm is a case that is handled directly , rather than by a pplying the algorithm recursively .\\nThe binary search algorithm actually has another type of bas e case: If we ﬁnd the element we\\nare looking for in the middle of the list, we are done. There is no need for further recursion.\\nThe second consideration has to do with the parameters to the subroutine. The problem is\\nphrased in terms of searching for a value in a list. In the orig inal, non-recursive binary search\\nsubroutine, the list was given as an array . However, in the re cursive approach, we have to\\nable to apply the subroutine recursively to just a part of the original list. Where the original\\nsubroutine was designed to search an entire array , the recur sive subroutine must be able to\\nsearch part of an array . The parameters to the subroutine mus t tell it what part of the array\\nto search. This illustrates a general fact that in order to so lve a problem recursively , it is often\\nnecessary to generalize the problem slightly .\\nHere is a recursive binary search algorithm that searches fo r a given value in part of an\\narray of integers:\\n/**\\n* Search in the array A in positions numbered loIndex to hiIndex,\\n* inclusive, for the specified value. If the value is found, r eturn\\n* the index in the array where it occurs. If the value is not found,'),\n",

T o search an entire array , it is only necessar y to call binarySearch(A, 0,\\nA.length - 1, value). In the two base cases—when there are no elements in the speci ﬁed\\nrange of indices and when the value is found in the middle of th e range—the subroutine can\\nreturn an answer immediately , without using recursion. In t he other cases, it uses a recursive\\ncall to compute the answer and returns that answer.\\nMost people ﬁnd it diﬃcult at ﬁrst to convince themselves tha t recursion actually works.\\nThe key is to note two things that must be true for recursion to work properly: There must\\nbe one or more base cases, which can be handled without using r ecursion. And when recursion\\nis applied during the solution of a problem, it must be applie d to a problem that is in some\\nsense smaller—that is, closer to the base cases—than the ori ginal problem. The idea is that\\nif you can solve small problems and if you can reduce big probl ems to smaller problems, then\\nyou can solve problems of any size. Ultimately , of course, th e big problems have to be reduced,\\npossibly in many , many steps, to the very smallest problems ( the base cases). Doing so might\\ninvolve an immense amount of detailed bookkeeping. But the c omputer does that bookkeeping,\\nnot you! As a programmer, you lay out the big picture: the base cases and the reduction of\\nbig problems to smaller problems. The computer takes care of the details involved in reducing\\na big problem, in many steps, all the way down to base cases. T r ying to think through this\\nreduction in detail is likely to drive you crazy , and will pro bably make you think that recursion\\nis hard. Whereas in fact, recursion is an elegant and powerfu l method that is often the simplest\\napproach to solving a complex problem.\\nA common error in writing recursive subroutines is to violat e one of the two rules: There\\nmust be one or more base cases, and when the subroutine is appl ied recursively , it must be\\napplied to a problem that is smaller than the original proble m.

Next, we turn to a problem that is easy to so lve with recursion but diﬃcult\\nto solve without it. This is a standard example known as “The T owers of Hanoi.” The problem\\ninvolves a stack of various-sized disks, piled up on a base in order of decreasing size. The object\\nis to move the stack from one base to another, subject to two ru les: Only one disk can be moved\\nat a time, and no disk can ever be placed on top of a smaller disk . There is a third base that\\ncan be used as a “spare.” The starting situation for a stack of ten disks is shown in the top\\nhalf of the following picture. The situation after a number o f moves have been made is shown\\nin the bottom half of the picture. These pictures are from the applet at the end of Section 9.5,\\nwhich displays an animation of the step-by-step solution of the problem.\\nThe problem is to move ten disks from Stack 0 to Stack 1, subjec t to certain rules. Stack\\n2 can be used as a spare location. Can we reduce this to smaller problems of the same type,\\npossibly generalizing the problem a bit to make this possibl e? It seems natural to consider the\\nsize of the problem to be the number of disks to be moved. If the re are N disks in Stack 0, we\\nknow that we will eventually have to move the bottom disk from Stack 0 to Stack 1. But before\\nwe can do that, according to the rules, the ﬁrst N-1 disks must be on Stack 2. Once we’ve\\nmoved the N-th disk to Stack 1, we must move the other N-1 disks from Stack 2 to Stack 1 to\\ncomplete the solution. But moving N-1 disks is the same type of problem as moving N disks,\\nexcept that it’s a smaller version of the problem. This is exa ctly what we need to do recursion!\\nThe problem has to be generalized a bit, because the smaller p roblems involve moving disks\\nfrom Stack 0 to Stack 2 or from Stack 2 to Stack 1, instead of fro m Stack 0 to Stack 1. In the\\nrecursive subroutine that solves the problem, the stacks th at serve as the source and destination'),\n",

The base case is\\nwhen there is only one disk to be moved. The solution in this ca se is trivial: Just move the disk\\nin one step. Here is a version of the subroutine that will prin t out step-by-step instructions for\\nsolving the problem:\\n/**\\n* Solve the problem of moving the number of disks specified\\n* by the first parameter from the stack specified by the\\n* second parameter to the stack specified by the third\\n* parameter. The stack specified by the fourth parameter\\n* is available for use as a spare.

The recursion works because\\neach recursive call involves a smaller number of disks, and t he problem is trivial to solve in\\nthe base case, when there is only one disk.

LINKED DA T A STRUCTURES AND RECURSION\\nThe output of this program shows you a mass of detail that you d on’t really want to think\\nabout! The diﬃculty of following the details contrasts shar ply with the simplicity and elegance\\nof the recursive solution. Of course, you really want to leav e the details to the computer. It’s\\nmuch more interesting to watch the applet from Section 9.5, w hich shows the solution graph-\\nically . That applet uses the same recursive subroutine, exc ept that the System.out.println\\nstatements are replaced by commands that show the image of th e disk being moved from one\\nstack to another.\\nThere is, by the way , a story that explains the name of this pro blem. According to this\\nstory , on the ﬁrst day of creation, a group of monks in an isola ted tower near Hanoi were given\\na stack of 64 disks and were assigned the task of moving one dis k every day , according to the\\nrules of the T owers of Hanoi problem. On the day that they comp lete their task of moving all\\nthe disks from one stack to another, the universe will come to an end. But don’t worry . The\\nnumber of steps required to solve the problem for N disks is 2 N - 1, and 2 64 - 1 days is over\\n50,000,000,000,000 years. W e have a long way to go.\\n(In the terminology of Section 8.6, the T owers of Hanoi algor ithm has a run time that is\\nΘ(2 n), where n is the number of disks that have to be moved. Since th e exponential function\\n2n grows so quickly , the T owers of Hanoi problem can be solved in practice only for a small\\nnumber of disks.)\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nBy the way , in addtion to the graphical T owers of Hanoi applet at the end of this chapter,\\nthere are two other end-of-chapter applets in the on-line ve rsion of this text that use recursion.\\nOne is a maze-solving applet from the end of Section 11.5, and the other is a pentominos applet\\nfrom the end of Section 10.5.\\nThe Maze applet ﬁrst builds a random maze. It then tries to sol ve the maze by ﬁnding a\\npath through the maze from the upper left corner to the lower r ight corner. This problem is\\nactually very similar to a “blob-counting” problem that is c onsidered later in this section. The\\nrecursive maze-solving routine starts from a given square, and it visits each neighboring square\\nand calls itself recursively from there. The recursion ends if the routine ﬁnds itself at the lower\\nright corner of the maze.\\nThe Pentominos applet is an implementation of a classic puzz le. A pentomino is a connected\\nﬁgure made up of ﬁve equal-sized squares. There are exactly t welve ﬁgures that can be made\\nin this way , not counting all the possible rotations and reﬂe ctions of the basic ﬁgures. The\\nproblem is to place the twelve pentominos on an 8-by-8 board i n which four of the squares\\nhave already been marked as ﬁlled. The recursive solution lo oks at a board that has already\\nbeen partially ﬁlled with pentominos. The subroutine looks at each remaining piece in turn. It\\ntries to place that piece in the next available place on the bo ard. If the piece ﬁts, it calls itself\\nrecursively to try to ﬁll in the rest of the solution. If that f ails, then the subroutine goes on to\\nthe next piece. A generalized version of the pentominos appl et with many more features can\\nbe found at http://math.hws.edu/xJava/PentominosSolver /.\\nThe Maze applet and the Pentominos applet are fun to watch, an d they give nice visual\\nrepresentations of recursion.\\n9.1.3 A Recursive Sorting Algorithm\\nT urning next to an application that is perhaps more practica l, we’ll look at a recursive algorithm\\nfor sorting an array .

This item is called the pivot. (In practice, I’ll just use the ﬁrst item in\\nthe list.) Move all the items that are smaller than the pivot t o the beginning of the list, and\\nmove all the items that are larger than the pivot to the end of t he list. Now, put the pivot\\nbetween the two groups of items. This puts the pivot in the pos ition that it will occupy in the\\nﬁnal, completely sorted array . It will not have to be moved ag ain.

RECURSION 435\\n}\\n}\\nAs usual, we had to generalize the problem. The original prob lem was to sort an array , but\\nthe recursive algorithm is set up to sort a speciﬁed part of an array . T o sort an entire array , A,\\nusing the quickSort() subroutine, you would call quicksort(A, 0, A.length - 1).\\nQuicksort is an interesting example from the point of view of the analysis of algorithms\\n(Section 8.6), because its average case run time diﬀers grea tly from its worst case run time.\\nHere is a very informal analysis, starting with the average c ase: Note that an application of\\nquicksortStep divides a problem into two sub-problems. On t he average, the subproblems will\\nbe of approximately the same size. A problem of size n is divid ed into two problems that are\\nroughly of size n/2; these are then divided into four problem s that are roughly of size n/4;\\nand so on. Since the problem size is divided by 2 on each level, there will be approximately\\nlog(n) levels of subdivision. The amount of processing on ea ch level is proportional to n. (On\\nthe top level, each element in the array is looked at and possi bly moved. On the second level,\\nwhere there are two subproblems, every element but one in the array is part of one of those\\ntwo subproblems and must be looked at and possibly moved, so t here is a total of about n\\nsteps in both subproblems combined. Similarly , on the third level, there are four subproblems\\nand a total of about n steps in all four subproblems combined o n that level. . . .) With a total\\nof n steps on each level and approximately log(n) levels in th e average case, the average case\\nrun time for Quicksort is Θ(n*log(n)). This analysis assume s that quicksortStep divides a\\nproblem into two approximately equal parts. However, in the worst case, each application of\\nquicksortStep divides a problem of size n into a problem of si ze 0 and a problem of size n-1.\\nThis happens when the pivot element ends up at the beginning o r end of the array . In this\\nworst case, there are n levels of subproblems, and the worst- case run time is Θ(n 2). The worst\\ncase is very rare—it depends on the items in the array being ar ranged in a very special way , so\\nthe average performance of Quicksort can be very good even th ough it is not so good in certain\\nrare cases. There are sorting algorithms that have both an av erage case and a worst case run\\ntime of Θ(n*log(n)). One example is MergeSort, which you can look up if you are interested.\\n9.1.4 Blob Counting\\nThe program Blobs.java displays a grid of small white and gray squares. The gray squa res are\\nconsidered to be “ﬁlled” and the white squares are “empty .” F or the purposes of this example,\\nwe deﬁne a “blob” to consist of a ﬁlled square and all the ﬁlled squares that can be reached\\nfrom it by moving up, down, left, and right through other ﬁlle d squares. If the user clicks on\\nany ﬁlled square in the program, the computer will count the s quares in the blob that contains\\nthe clicked square, and it will change the color of those squa res to red. The program has several\\ncontrols. There is a “New Blobs” button; clicking this butto n will create a new random pattern\\nin the grid. A pop-up menu speciﬁes the approximate percenta ge of squares that will be ﬁlled\\nin the new pattern. The more ﬁlled squares, the larger the blo bs. And a button labeled “Count\\nthe Blobs” will tell you how many diﬀerent blobs there are in t he pattern. Y ou can try an applet\\nversion of the program in the on-line version of the book. Her e is a picture of the program after\\nthe user has clicked one of the ﬁlled squares:'),\n",

LINKED DA T A STRUCTURES AND RECURSION\\nRecursion is used in this program to count the number of squar es in a blob. Without\\nrecursion, this would be a very diﬃcult thing to implement. R ecursion makes it relatively easy ,\\nbut it still requires a new technique, which is also useful in a number of other applications.\\nThe data for the grid of squares is stored in a two dimensional array of boolean values,\\nboolean[][] filled;\\nThe value of filled[r][c] is true if the square in row r and in column c of the grid is\\nﬁlled. The number of rows in the grid is stored in an instance v ariable named rows, and the\\nnumber of columns is stored in columns. The program uses a recursive instance method named\\ngetBlobSize() to count the number of squares in the blob that contains the sq uare in a given\\nrow r and column c. If there is no ﬁlled square at position (r,c), then the answer is zero.\\nOtherwise, getBlobSize() has to count all the ﬁlled squares that can be reached from the\\nsquare at position (r,c). The idea is to use getBlobSize() recursively to get the number of\\nﬁlled squares that can be reached from each of the neighborin g positions, (r+1,c), (r-1,c),\\n(r,c+1), and (r,c-1). Add up these numbers, and add one to count the square at (r,c)\\nitself, and you get the total number of ﬁlled squares that can be reached from (r,c).

F rom there, you move up one row, and from there you move down o ne row. . . . Back\\nand forth forever! W e have to make sure that a square is only co unted and processed once, so\\nwe don’t end up going around in circles. The solution is to lea ve a trail of breadcrumbs—or on\\nthe computer a trail of boolean values—to mark the squares th at you’ve already visited.

Th e remaining, unvisited squares\\nare reduced in number, so deﬁnite progress has been made in re ducing the size of the problem.\\nInﬁnite recursion is avoided!\\nA second boolean array , visited[r][c], is used to keep track of which squares have already\\nbeen visited and processed. It is assumed that all the values in this array are set to false before\\ngetBlobSize() is called. As getBlobSize() encounters unvisited squares, it marks them as\\nvisited by setting the corresponding entry in the visited array to true. When getBlobSize()\\nencounters a square that is already visited, it doesn’t coun t it or process it further. The\\ntechnique of “marking” items as they are encountered is one t hat used over and over in the\\nprogramming of recursive algorithms.

LINKED DA T A STRUCTURES 439\\n9.2 Linked Data Structures\\nEvery useful object contains instance variables. When the type of an instance va riable is\\ngiven by a class or interface name, the variable can hold a ref erence to another object. Such\\na reference is also called a pointer, and we say that the varia ble points to the object. (Of\\ncourse, any variable that can contain a reference to an objec t can also contain the special value\\nnull, which points to nowhere.) When one object contains an insta nce variable that points to\\nanother object, we think of the objects as being “linked” by t he pointer. Data structures of\\ngreat complexity can be constructed by linking objects toge ther.\\n9.2.1 Recursive Linking\\nSomething interesting happens when an object contains an in stance variable that can refer to\\nanother object of the same type. In that case, the deﬁnition o f the object’s class is recursive.\\nSuch recursion arises naturally in many cases. F or example, consider a class designed to repre-\\nsent employees at a company . Suppose that every employee exc ept the boss has a supervisor,\\nwho is another employee of the company . Then the Employee class would naturally contain an\\ninstance variable of type Employee that points to the employee’s supervisor:\\n/**\\n* An object of type Employee holds data about one employee.\\n*/\\npublic class Employee {\\nString name; // Name of the employee.\\nEmployee supervisor; // The employee’s supervisor.\\n.\\n. // (Other instance variables and methods.)\\n.\\n} // end class Employee\\nIf emp is a variable of type Employee, then emp.supervisor is another variable of type\\nEmployee. If emp refers to the boss, then the value of emp.supervisor should be null to\\nindicate the fact that the boss has no supervisor. If we wante d to print out the name of the\\nemployee’s supervisor, for example, we could use the follow ing Java statement:\\nif ( emp.supervisor == null) {\\nSystem.out.println( emp.name + \" is the boss and has no supervisor!\" );\\n}\\nelse {\\nSystem.out.print( \"The supervisor of \" + emp.name + \" is \" );\\nSystem.out.println( emp.supervisor.name );\\n}\\nNow, suppose that we want to know how many levels of superviso rs there are between a\\ngiven employee and the boss. W e just have to follow the chain o f command through a series of\\nsupervisor links, and count how many steps it takes to get to the boss:\\nif ( emp.supervisor == null ) {\\nSystem.out.println( emp.name + \" is the boss!\" );\\n}\\nelse {'),\n",

The count\\nvariable is incremented each time runner “visits” a new employee. The loop ends when\\nrunner.supervisor is null, which indicates that runner has reached the boss. At that point,\\ncount has counted the number of steps between emp and the boss.\\nIn this example, the supervisor variable is quite natural and useful. In fact, data structur es\\nthat are built by linking objects together are so useful that they are a major topic of study\\nin computer science. W e’ll be looking at a few typical exampl es. In this section and the\\nnext, we’ll be looking at linked lists . A linked list consists of a chain of objects of the same\\ntype, linked together by pointers from one object to the next . This is much like the chain of\\nsupervisors between emp and the boss in the above example. It’s also possible to have m ore\\ncomplex situations, in which one object can contain links to several other objects. W e’ll look\\nat an example of this in Section 9.4.\\nn u l l\\nW h e n a n o b j e c t c o n t a i n s a r e f e r e n c e t o a n o b j e c t o f t h e\\ns a m e t y p e , t h e n s e v e r a l o b j e c t s c a n b e l i n k e d t o g e t h e r\\ni n t o a l i s t .

LINKED DA T A STRUCTURES 441\\n9.2.2 Linked Lists\\nF or most of the examples in the rest of this section, linked li sts will be constructed out of objects\\nbelonging to the class Node which is deﬁned as follows:\\nclass Node {\\nString item;\\nNode next;\\n}\\nThe term node is often used to refer to one of the objects in a linked data str ucture. Objects\\nof type Node can be chained together as shown in the top part of the above pi cture. Each node\\nholds a String and a pointer to the next node in the list (if any). The last nod e in such a list can\\nalways be identiﬁed by the fact that the instance variable next in the last node holds the value\\nnull instead of a pointer to another node. The purpose of the chain of nodes is to represent a\\nlist of strings. The ﬁrst string in the list is stored in the ﬁr st node, the second string is stored in\\nthe second node, and so on. The pointers and the node objects a re used to build the structure,\\nbut the data that we are interested in representing is the lis t of strings. Of course, we could\\njust as easily represent a list of integers or a list of JButtons or a list of any other type of data\\nby changing the type of the item that is stored in each node.\\nAlthough the Nodes in this example are very simple, we can use them to illustrate the\\ncommon operations on linked lists. Typical operations incl ude deleting nodes from the list,\\ninserting new nodes into the list, and searching for a speciﬁ ed String among the items in the\\nlist. W e will look at subroutines to perform all of these oper ations, among others.\\nF or a linked list to be used in a program, that program needs a v ariable that refers to the\\nﬁrst node in the list. It only needs a pointer to the ﬁrst node s ince all the other nodes in the list\\ncan be accessed by starting at the ﬁrst node and following lin ks along the list from one node to\\nthe next. In my examples, I will always use a variable named head, of type Node, that points\\nto the ﬁrst node in the linked list. When the list is empty , the value of head is null.\\nn u l l\\n\" b i l l \" \" f r e d \" \" m a r y \"\\n\" j a n e \"\\nh e a d :\\nF o\\nr a l i s t t\\no\\nb e u s e f u l , t h e r e m u s t b e a v a r i a b l e\\nt h a t p\\no\\ni n t s t\\no\\nt h e ﬁ r s t n\\no\\nd e i n t h e l i s t .

The common\\npattern is to start at the head of the list, then move from each node to the next by by following\\nthe pointer in the node, stopping when the null that marks the end of the list is reached. If\\nhead is a variable of type Node that points to the ﬁrst node in the list, then the general form\\nof the code is:\\nNode runner; // A pointer that will be used to traverse the lis t.\\nrunner = head; // Start with runner pointing to the head of the list.\\nwhile ( runner != null ) { // Continue until null is encountere d.\\nprocess( runner.item ); // Do something with the item in the c urrent node.'),\n",

LINKED DA T A STRUCTURES AND RECURSION\\nrunner = runner.next; // Move on to the next node in the list.\\n}\\nOur only access to the list is through the variable head, so we start by getting a copy of the\\nvalue in head with the assignment statement runner = head. W e need a copy of head because\\nwe are going to change the value of runner. W e can’t change the value of head, or we would\\nlose our only access to the list! The variable runner will point to each node of the list in turn.\\nWhen runner points to one of the nodes in the list, runner.next is a pointer to the next node\\nin the list, so the assignment statement runner = runner.next moves the pointer along the\\nlist from each node to the next. W e know that we’ve reached the end of the list when runner\\nbecomes equal to null. Note that our list-processing code works even for an empty l ist, since\\nfor an empty list the value of head is null and the body of the while loop is not executed at\\nall. As an example, we can print all the strings in a list of Strings by saying:\\nNode runner = head;\\nwhile ( runner != null ) {\\nSystem.out.println( runner.item );\\nrunner = runner.next;\\n}\\nThe while loop can, by the way , be rewritten as a for loop. Remember that even though the\\nloop control variable in a for loop is often numerical, that is not a requirement. Here is a for\\nloop that is equivalent to the above while loop:\\nfor ( Node runner = head; runner != null; runner = runner.next ) {\\nSystem.out.println( runner.item );\\n}\\nSimilarly , we can traverse a list of integers to add up all the numbers in the list. A linked\\nlist of integers can be constructed using the class\\npublic class IntNode {\\nint item; // One of the integers in the list.\\nIntNode next; // Pointer to the next node in the list.\\n}\\nIf head is a variable of type IntNode that points to a linked list of integers, we can ﬁnd the sum\\nof the integers in the list using:\\nint sum = 0;\\nIntNode runner = head;\\nwhile ( runner != null ) {\\nsum = sum + runner.item; // Add current item to the sum.\\nrunner = runner.next;\\n}\\nSystem.out.println(\"The sum of the list items is \" + sum);\\nIt is also possible to use recursion to process a linked list. Recursion is rarely the natural\\nway to process a list, since it’s so easy to use a loop to traver se the list. However, understanding\\nhow to apply recursion to lists can help with understanding t he recursive processing of more\\ncomplex data structures. A non-empty linked list can be thou ght of as consisting of two parts:\\nthe head of the list, which is just the ﬁrst node in the list, and the tail of the list, which\\nconsists of the remainder of the list after the head. Note tha t the tail is itself a linked list and\\nthat it is shorter than the original list (by one node). This i s a natural setup for recursion,\\nwhere the problem of processing a list can be divided into pro cessing the head and recursively'),\n",

F or example, here is a recursive algo rithm for adding up the numbers\\nin a linked list of integers:\\nif the list is empty then\\nreturn 0 (since there are no numbers to be added up)\\notherwise\\nlet listsum = the number in the head node\\nlet tailsum be the sum of the numbers in the tail list (recursively)\\nadd tailsum to listsum\\nreturn listsum\\nOne remaining question is, how do we get the tail of a non-empt y linked list? If head is a\\nvariable that points to the head node of the list, then head.next is a variable that points to\\nthe second node of the list—and that node is in fact the ﬁrst no de of the tail. So, we can view\\nhead.next as a pointer to the tail of the list. One special case is when th e original list consists\\nof a single node. In that case, the tail of the list is empty , an d head.next is null. Since an\\nempty list is represented by a null pointer, head.next represents the tail of the list even in this\\nspecial case. This allows us to write a recursive list-summi ng function in Java as\\n/**\\n* Compute the sum of all the integers in a linked list of intege rs.\\n* @param head a pointer to the first node in the linked list\\n*/\\npublic static int addItemsInList( IntNode head ) {\\nif ( head == null ) {\\n// Base case: The list is empty, so the sum is zero.\\nreturn 0;\\n}\\nelse {\\n// Recursive case: The list is non-empty. Find the sum of\\n// the tail list, and add that to the item in the head node.\\n// (Note that this case could be written simply as\\n// return head.item + addItemsInList( head.next );)\\nint listsum = head.item;\\nint tailsum = addItemsInList( head.next );\\nlistsum = listsum + tailsum;\\nreturn listsum;\\n}\\n}\\nI will ﬁnish by presenting a list-processing problem that is easy to solve with recursion, but\\nquite tricky to solve without it. The problem is to print out a ll the strings in a linked list of\\nstrings in the reverse of the order in which they occur in the list. Note that when we d o this,\\nthe item in the head of a list is printed out after all the items in the tail of the list. This leads\\nto the following recursive routine. Y ou should convince you rself that it works, and you should\\nthink about trying to do the same thing without using recursi on:\\npublic static void printReversed( Node head ) {\\nif ( head == null ) {\\n// Base case: The list is empty, and there is nothing to print.\\nreturn;\\n}\\nelse {'),\n",

The subroutines that we consider are instance me thods in a class, StringList. An\\nobject of type StringList represents a linked list of nodes. The class has a private ins tance\\nvariable named head of type Node that points to the ﬁrst node in the list, or is null if the list i s\\nempty .

W e have to compare searchItem to each item in the list. This is an example of\\nbasic list traversal and processing. However, in this case, we can stop processing if we ﬁnd the\\nitem that we are looking for.\\n/**\\n* Searches the list for a specified item.\\n* @param searchItem the item that is to be searched for\\n* @return true if searchItem is one of the items in the list or false if\\n* searchItem does not occur in the list.\\n*/\\npublic boolean find(String searchItem) {\\nNode runner; // A pointer for traversing the list.\\nrunner = head; // Start by looking at the head of the list.\\n// (head is an instance variable! )\\nwhile ( runner != null ) {\\n// Go through the list looking at the string in each\\n// node.

LINKED DA T A STRUCTURES 445\\n9.2.4 Inserting into a Linked List\\nThe problem of inserting a new item into a linked list is more d iﬃcult, at least in the case\\nwhere the item is inserted into the middle of the list. (In fac t, it’s probably the most diﬃcult\\noperation on linked data structures that you’ll encounter i n this chapter.) In the StringList\\nclass, the items in the nodes of the linked list are kept in increasing order. W hen a new item\\nis inserted into the list, it must be inserted at the correct p osition according to this ordering.\\nThis means that, usually , we will have to insert the new item s omewhere in the middle of the\\nlist, between two existing nodes. T o do this, it’s convenien t to have two variables of type Node,\\nwhich refer to the existing nodes that will lie on either side of the new node. In the following\\nillustration, these variables are previous and runner. Another variable, newNode, refers to the\\nnew node. In order to do the insertion, the link from previous to runner must be “broken,”\\nand new links from previous to newNode and from newNode to runner must be added:\\np r e v i o u s :\\nn e w N o d e :\\nr u n n e r :\\nI n s e r t i n g a n e w n o d e\\ni n t o t h e m i d d l e o f a l i s t\\nOnce we have previous and runner pointing to the right nodes, the command\\n“ previous.next = newNode;” can be used to make previous.next point to the new node,\\ninstead of to the node indicated by runner. And the command “ newNode.next = runner” will\\nset newNode.next to point to the correct place. However, before we can use thes e commands,\\nwe need to set up runner and previous as shown in the illustration. The idea is to start at\\nthe ﬁrst node of the list, and then move along the list past all the items that are less than the\\nnew item. While doing this, we have to be aware of the danger of “falling oﬀ the end of the\\nlist.” That is, we can’t continue if runner reaches the end of the list and becomes null. If\\ninsertItem is the item that is to be inserted, and if we assume that it does , in fact, belong\\nsomewhere in the middle of the list, then the following code w ould correctly position previous\\nand runner:\\nNode runner, previous;\\nprevious = head; // Start at the beginning of the list.\\nrunner = head.next;\\nwhile ( runner != null && runner.item.compareTo(insertItem) < 0 ) {\\nprevious = runner; // \"previous = previous.next\" would also work\\nrunner = runner.next;\\n}'),\n",

See Subs ection 2.3.2.)\\nThis is ﬁne, except that the assumption that the new node is in serted into the middle of\\nthe list is not always valid. It might be that insertItem is less than the ﬁrst item of the list.\\nIn that case, the new node must be inserted at the head of the li st. This can be done with the\\ninstructions\\nnewNode.next = head; // Make newNode.next point to the old he ad.\\nhead = newNode; // Make newNode the new head of the list.\\nIt is also possible that the list is empty . In that case, newNode will become the ﬁrst and only\\nnode in the list. This can be accomplished simply by setting head = newNode. The following\\ninsert() method from the StringList class covers all of these possibilities:\\n/**\\n* Insert a specified item to the list, keeping the list in order.\\n* @param insertItem the item that is to be inserted.\\n*/\\npublic void insert(String insertItem) {\\nNode newNode; // A Node to contain the new item.\\nnewNode = new Node();\\nnewNode.item = insertItem; // (N.B. newNode.next is null.)\\nif ( head == null ) {\\n// The new item is the first (and only) one in the list.\\n// Set head to point to it.\\nhead = newNode;\\n}\\nelse if ( head.item.compareTo(insertItem) >= 0 ) {\\n// The new item is less than the first item in the list,\\n// so it has to be inserted at the head of the list.\\nnewNode.next = head;\\nhead = newNode;\\n}\\nelse {\\n// The new item belongs somewhere after the first item\\n// in the list.

LINKED DA T A STRUCTURES 447\\nIf you were paying close attention to the above discussion, y ou might have noticed that\\nthere is one special case which is not mentioned. What happen s if the new node has to be\\ninserted at the end of the list? This will happen if all the items in the list are le ss than the new\\nitem. In fact, this case is already handled correctly by the s ubroutine, in the last part of the\\nif statement. If insertItem is greater than all the items in the list, then the while loop will\\nend when runner has traversed the entire list and become null. However, when that happens,\\nprevious will be left pointing to the last node in the list. Setting previous.next = newNode\\nadds newNode onto the end of the list. Since runner is null, the command newNode.next =\\nrunner sets newNode.next to null, which is the correct value that is needed to mark the end\\nof the list.\\n9.2.5 Deleting from a Linked List\\nThe delete operation is similar to insert, although a little simpler. There are still special cases\\nto consider. When the ﬁrst node in the list is to be deleted, th en the value of head has to be\\nchanged to point to what was previously the second node in the list. Since head.next refers to\\nthe second node in the list, this can be done by setting head = head.next. (Once again, you\\nshould check that this works when head.next is null, that is, when there is no second node in\\nthe list. In that case, the list becomes empty .)\\nIf the node that is being deleted is in the middle of the list, t hen we can set up previous and\\nrunner with runner pointing to the node that is to be deleted and with previous pointing to the\\nnode that precedes that node in the list. Once that is done, th e command “ previous.next =\\nrunner.next;” will delete the node. The deleted node will be garbage coll ected. I encourage\\nyou to draw a picture for yourself to illustrate this operati on. Here is the complete code for the\\ndelete() method:\\n/**\\n* Delete a specfied item from the list, if that item is present.\\n* If multiple copies of the item are present in the list, only\\n* the one that comes first in the list is deleted.\\n* @param deleteItem the item to be deleted\\n* @return true if the item was found and deleted, or false if the item\\n* was not in the list.\\n*/\\npublic boolean delete(String deleteItem) {\\nif ( head == null ) {\\n// The list is empty, so it certainly doesn’t contain deleteString.\\nreturn false;\\n}\\nelse if ( head.item.equals(deleteItem) ) {\\n// The string is the first item of the list. Remove it.\\nhead = head.next;\\nreturn true;\\n}\\nelse {\\n// The string, if it occurs at all, is somewhere beyond the\\n// first element of the list. Search the list.\\nNode runner; // A node for traversing the list.\\nNode previous; // Always points to the node preceding runner .\\nrunner = head.next; // Start by looking at the SECOND list nod e.\\nprevious = head;'),\n",

In the previous section, we used a linked list to st ore an ordered list of Strings, and\\nwe implemented insert, delete, and find operations on that list. However, we could easily\\nhave stored the list of Strings in an array or ArrayList, instead of in a linked list. W e could still\\nhave implemented the same operations on the list. The implem entations of these operations\\nwould have been diﬀerent, but their interfaces and logical b ehavior would still be the same.\\nThe term abstract data type , or ADT , refers to a set of possible values and a set of\\noperations on those values, without any speciﬁcation of how the values are to be represented\\nor how the operations are to be implemented. An “ordered list of strings” can be deﬁned as an\\nabstract data type. Any sequence of Strings that is arranged in increasing order is a possible\\nvalue of this data type. The operations on the data type inclu de inserting a new string, deleting\\na string, and ﬁnding a string in the list. There are often seve ral diﬀerent ways to implement the\\nsame abstract data type. F or example, the “ordered list of st rings” ADT can be implemented\\nas a linked list or as an array . A program that only depends on t he abstract deﬁnition of the\\nADT can use either implementation, interchangeably . In par ticular, the implementation of the\\nADT can be changed without aﬀecting the program as a whole. Th is can make the program\\neasier to debug and maintain, so ADTs are an important tool in software engineering.\\nIn this section, we’ll look at two common abstract data types , stacks and queues. Both\\nstacks and queues are often implemented as linked lists, but that is not the only possible\\nimplementation. Y ou should think of the rest of this section partly as a discussion of stacks\\nand queues and partly as a case study in ADTs.'),\n",

O nly the top item on the stack is\\naccessible at any given time. It can be removed from the stack with an operation called pop.\\nAn item lower down on the stack can only be removed after all th e items on top of it have been\\npopped oﬀ the stack. A new item can be added to the top of the sta ck with an operation called\\npush. W e can make a stack of any type of items. If, for example, the i tems are values of type\\nint, then the push and pop operations can be implemented as insta nce methods\\n• void push (int newItem) — Add newItem to top of stack.\\n• int pop() — Remove the top int from the stack and return it.\\nIt is an error to try to pop an item from an empty stack, so it is i mportant to be able to tell\\nwhether a stack is empty . W e need another stack operation to d o the test, implemented as an\\ninstance method\\n• boolean isEmpty() — Returns true if the stack is empty .\\nThis deﬁnes a “stack of ints” as an abstract data type. This AD T can be implemented in several\\nways, but however it is implemented, its behavior must corre spond to the abstract mental image\\nof a stack.\\nIn the linked list implementation of a stack, the top of the st ack is actually the node at the\\nhead of the list. It is easy to add and remove nodes at the front of a linked list—much easier\\nthan inserting and deleting nodes in the middle of the list. H ere is a class that implements the\\n“stack of ints” ADT using a linked list. (It uses a static nest ed class to represent the nodes of\\nthe linked list.

Look at each horizontal and vertical neighbor of that square.\\nIf the neighbor has not already been encountered, write its l ocation on a new index card and\\nput the card in the pile.\\nWhile a square is in the pile, waiting to be processed, it is co lored red; that is, red squares\\nhave been encountered but not yet processed. When a square is taken from the pile and\\nprocessed, its color changes to gray . Once a square has been c olored gray , its color won’t\\nchange again. Eventually , all the squares have been process ed, and the procedure ends. In the\\nindex card analogy , the pile of cards has been emptied.\\nThe program can use your choice of three methods: Stack, Queu e, and Random. In each\\ncase, the same general procedure is used. The only diﬀerence is how the “pile of index cards” is\\nmanaged. F or a stack, cards are added and removed at the top of the pile. F or a queue, cards\\nare added to the bottom of the pile and removed from the top. In the random case, the card to\\nbe processed is picked at random from among all the cards in th e pile. The order of processing\\nis very diﬀerent in these three cases.\\nY ou should experiment with the program to see how it all works . T ry to understand how\\nstacks and queues are being used. T ry starting from one of the corner squares. While the process\\nis going on, you can click on other white squares, and they wil l be added to the pile. When you\\ndo this with a stack, you should notice that the square you cli ck is processed immediately , and\\nall the red squares that were already waiting for processing have to wait. On the other hand, if\\nyou do this with a queue, the square that you click will wait it s turn until all the squares that\\nwere already in the pile have been processed.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nQueues seem very natural because they occur so often in real l ife, but there are times when\\nstacks are appropriate and even essential. F or example, con sider what happens when a routine\\ncalls a subroutine. The ﬁrst routine is suspended while the s ubroutine is executed, and it will\\ncontinue only when the subroutine returns. Now, suppose tha t the subroutine calls a second\\nsubroutine, and the second subroutine calls a third, and so o n. Each subroutine is suspended\\nwhile the subsequent subroutines are executed. The compute r has to keep track of all the\\nsubroutines that are suspended. It does this with a stack.\\nWhen a subroutine is called, an activation record is created for that subroutine. The\\nactivation record contains information relevant to the exe cution of the subroutine, such as its\\nlocal variables and parameters. The activation record for t he subroutine is placed on a stack.\\nIt will be removed from the stack and destroyed when the subro utine returns. If the subroutine\\ncalls another subroutine, the activation record of the seco nd subroutine is pushed onto the\\nstack, on top of the activation record of the ﬁrst subroutine . The stack can continue to grow\\nas more subroutines are called, and it shrinks as those subro utines return.'),\n",

LINKED DA T A STRUCTURES AND RECURSION\\n9.3.3 Postﬁx Expressions\\nAs another example, stacks can be used to evaluate postﬁx expressions . An ordinary mathe-\\nmatical expression such as 2+(15-12)*17 is called an inﬁx expression . In an inﬁx expression,\\nan operator comes in between its two operands, as in “ 2 + 2”. In a postﬁx expression, an oper-\\nator comes after its two operands, as in “ 2 2 +”. The inﬁx expression “ 2+(15-12)*17” would\\nbe written in postﬁx form as “ 2 15 12 - 17 * +”. The “ -” operator in this expression applies\\nto the two operands that precede it, namely “ 15” and “ 12”. The “ *” operator applies to the\\ntwo operands that precede it, namely “ 15 12 -” and “ 17”. And the “ +” operator applies to\\n“ 2” and “ 15 12 - 17 *”. These are the same computations that are done in the origin al inﬁx\\nexpression.\\nNow, suppose that we want to process the expression “ 2 15 12 - 17 * +”, from left to\\nright and ﬁnd its value. The ﬁrst item we encounter is the 2, but what can we do with it?\\nAt this point, we don’t know what operator, if any , will be app lied to the 2 or what the other\\noperand might be. W e have to remember the 2 for later processing. W e do this by pushing\\nit onto a stack. Moving on to the next item, we see a 15, which is pushed onto the stack on\\ntop of the 2. Then the 12 is added to the stack. Now, we come to the operator, “ -”. This\\noperation applies to the two operands that preceded it in the expression. W e have saved those\\ntwo operands on the stack. So, to process the “ -” operator, we pop two numbers from the\\nstack, 12 and 15, and compute 15 - 12 to get the answer 3. This 3 must be remembered to be\\nused in later processing, so we push it onto the stack, on top o f the 2 that is still waiting there.\\nThe next item in the expression is a 17, which is processed by pushing it onto the stack, on top\\nof the 3. T o process the next item, “ *”, we pop two numbers from the stack. The numbers are\\n17 and the 3 that represents the value of “ 15 12 -”. These numbers are multiplied, and the\\nresult, 51 is pushed onto the stack. The next item in the expression is a “ +” operator, which is\\nprocessed by popping 51 and 2 from the stack, adding them, and pushing the result, 53, onto\\nthe stack. Finally , we’ve come to the end of the expression. T he number on the stack is the\\nvalue of the entire expression, so all we have to do is pop the a nswer from the stack, and we\\nare done! The value of the expression is 53.\\nAlthough it’s easier for people to work with inﬁx expression s, postﬁx expressions have some\\nadvantages. F or one thing, postﬁx expressions don’t requir e parentheses or precedence rules.\\nThe order in which operators are applied is determined entir ely by the order in which they\\noccur in the expression. This allows the algorithm for evalu ating postﬁx expressions to be\\nfairly straightforward:\\nStart with an empty stack\\nfor each item in the expression:\\nif the item is a number:\\nPush the number onto the stack\\nelse if the item is an operator:\\nPop the operands from the stack // Can generate an error\\nApply the operator to the operands\\nPush the result onto the stack\\nelse\\nThere is an error in the expression\\nPop a number from the stack // Can generate an error\\nif the stack is not empty:\\nThere is an error in the expression\\nelse:\\nThe last number that was popped is the value of the expression'),\n",

ST ACKS, QUEUES, AND ADTS 457\\nErrors in an expression can be detected easily . F or example, in the expression “ 2 3 + *”,\\nthere are not enough operands for the “ *” operation. This will be detected in the algorithm\\nwhen an attempt is made to pop the second operand for “ *” from the stack, since the stack\\nwill be empty . The opposite problem occurs in “ 2 3 4 +”. There are not enough operators for\\nall the numbers. This will be detected when the 2 is left still sitting in the stack at the end of\\nthe algorithm.\\nThis algorithm is demonstrated in the sample program PostﬁxEval.java .

BINAR Y TREES 459\\nPostﬁx expressions are often used internally by computers. In fact, the Java virtual machine\\nis a “stack machine” which uses the stack-based approach to e xpression evaluation that we have\\nbeen discussing. The algorithm can easily be extended to han dle variables, as well as constants.\\nWhen a variable is encountered in the expression, the value o f the variable is pushed onto the\\nstack. It also works for operators with more or fewer than two operands. As many operands as\\nare needed are popped from the stack and the result is pushed b ack on to the stack. F or example,\\nthe unary minus operator, which is used in the expression “ -x”, has a single operand. W e\\nwill continue to look at expressions and expression evaluat ion in the next two sections.\\n9.4 Binary Trees\\nWe have seen in the two previous sections how objects can be linked into li sts. When an\\nobject contains two pointers to objects of the same type, str uctures can be created that are\\nmuch more complicated than linked lists. In this section, we ’ll look at one of the most basic and\\nuseful structures of this type: binary trees . Each of the objects in a binary tree contains two\\npointers, typically called left and right. In addition to these pointers, of course, the nodes\\ncan contain other types of data. F or example, a binary tree of integers could be made up of\\nobjects of the following type:\\nclass TreeNode {\\nint item; // The data in this node.\\nTreeNode left; // Pointer to the left subtree.\\nTreeNode right; // Pointer to the right subtree.\\n}\\nThe left and right pointers in a TreeNode can be null or can point to other objects of\\ntype TreeNode. A node that points to another node is said to be the parent of that node, and\\nthe node it points to is called a child . In the picture below, for example, node 3 is the parent\\nof node 6, and nodes 4 and 5 are children of node 2. Not every lin ked structure made up of\\ntree nodes is a binary tree. A binary tree must have the follow ing properties: There is exactly\\none node in the tree which has no parent. This node is called th e root of the tree. Every other\\nnode in the tree has exactly one parent. Finally , there can be no loops in a binary tree. That\\nis, it is not possible to follow a chain of pointers starting a t some node and arriving back at the\\nsame node.'),\n",

A leaf node can be recognized by the fact that\\nboth the left and right pointers in the node are null. In the standard picture of a binary tree,\\nthe root node is shown at the top and the leaf nodes at the botto m—which doesn’t show much\\nrespect for the analogy to real trees. But at least you can see the branching, tree-like structure\\nthat gives a binary tree its name.\\n9.4.1 T ree T raversal\\nConsider any node in a binary tree. Look at that node together with all its descendents (that\\nis, its children, the children of its children, and so on). Th is set of nodes forms a binary tree,\\nwhich is called a subtree of the original tree. F or example, in the picture, nodes 2, 4, and 5\\nform a subtree. This subtree is called the left subtree of the root. Similarly , nodes 3 and 6\\nmake up the right subtree of the root. W e can consider any non-empty binary tree to be ma de\\nup of a root node, a left subtree, and a right subtree. Either o r both of the subtrees can be\\nempty . This is a recursive deﬁnition, matching the recursiv e deﬁnition of the T reeNode class.\\nSo it should not be a surprise that recursive subroutines are often used to process trees.\\nConsider the problem of counting the nodes in a binary tree. ( As an exercise, you might\\ntry to come up with a non-recursive algorithm to do the counti ng, but you shouldn’t expect to\\nﬁnd one.) The heart of problem is keeping track of which nodes remain to be counted. It’s not\\nso easy to do this, and in fact it’s not even possible without a n auxiliary data structure such\\nas a stack or queue. With recursion, however, the algorithm i s almost trivial. Either the tree\\nis empty or it consists of a root and two subtrees. If the tree i s empty , the number of nodes is\\nzero. (This is the base case of the recursion.) Otherwise, us e recursion to count the nodes in\\neach subtree. Add the results from the subtrees together, an d add one to count the root. This\\ngives the total number of nodes in the tree. W ritten out in Jav a:\\n/**\\n* Count the nodes in the binary tree to which root points, and\\n* return the answer.

But the preorder printing also applies to each of the su btrees of the root. The root item\\nof the left subtree, 2, is printed before the other items in that subtree, 4 and 5. As for the right\\nsubtree of the root, 3 is output before 6. A preorder traversal applies at all levels in the tree.\\nThe other two traversal orders can be analyzed similarly .\\n9.4.2 Binary Sort T rees\\nOne of the examples in Section 9.2 was a linked list of strings , in which the strings were kept\\nin increasing order. While a linked list works well for a smal l number of strings, it becomes\\nineﬃcient for a large number of items. When inserting an item into the list, searching for that\\nitem’s position requires looking at, on average, half the it ems in the list. Finding an item in the\\nlist requires a similar amount of time. If the strings are sto red in a sorted array instead of in a\\nlinked list, then searching becomes more eﬃcient because bi nary search can be used. However,\\ninserting a new item into the array is still ineﬃcient since i t means moving, on average, half of\\nthe items in the array to make a space for the new item. A binary tree can be used to store\\nan ordered list of strings, or other items, in a way that makes both searching and insertion\\neﬃcient. A binary tree used in this way is called a binary sort tree.\\nA binary sort tree is a binary tree with the following propert y: F or every node in the tree,\\nthe item in that node is greater than every item in the left sub tree of that node, and it is less\\nthan or equal to all the items in the right subtree of that node . Here for example is a binary\\nsort tree containing items of type String. (In this picture, I haven’t bothered to draw all the\\npointer variables. Non-null pointers are shown as arrows.)'),\n",

In fact, this is really just anoth er way of expressing the deﬁnition.\\nF or example, if an inorder traversal is used to print the item s in the tree shown above, then the\\nitems will be in alphabetical order. The deﬁnition of an inor der traversal guarantees that all\\nthe items in the left subtree of “judy” are printed before “ju dy”, and all the items in the right\\nsubtree of “judy” are printed after “judy”. But the binary so rt tree property guarantees that\\nthe items in the left subtree of “judy” are precisely those th at precede “judy” in alphabetical\\norder, and all the items in the right subtree follow “judy” in alphabetical order. So, we know\\nthat “judy” is output in its proper alphabetical position. B ut the same argument applies to\\nthe subtrees. “Bill” will be output after “alice” and before “fred” and its descendents. “F red”\\nwill be output after “dave” and before “jane” and “joe”. And s o on.\\nSuppose that we want to search for a given item in a binary sear ch tree. Compare that item\\nto the root item of the tree. If they are equal, we’re done. If t he item we are looking for is\\nless than the root item, then we need to search the left subtre e of the root—the right subtree\\ncan be eliminated because it only contains items that are gre ater than or equal to the root.\\nSimilarly , if the item we are looking for is greater than the i tem in the root, then we only need\\nto look in the right subtree. In either case, the same procedu re can then be applied to search\\nthe subtree. Inserting a new item is similar: Start by search ing the tree for the position where\\nthe new item belongs. When that position is found, create a ne w node and attach it to the tree\\nat that position.\\nSearching and inserting are eﬃcient operations on a binary s earch tree, provided that the\\ntree is close to being balanced. A binary tree is balanced if for each node, the left subtree o f\\nthat node contains approximately the same number of nodes as the right subtree. In a perfectly\\nbalanced tree, the two numbers diﬀer by at most one. Not all bi nary trees are balanced, but if\\nthe tree is created by inserting items in a random order, ther e is a high probability that the tree\\nis approximately balanced. (If the order of insertion is not random, however, it’s quite possible\\nfor the tree to be very unbalanced.) During a search of any bin ary sort tree, every comparison\\neliminates one of two subtrees from further consideration. If the tree is balanced, that means\\ncutting the number of items still under consideration in hal f. This is exactly the same as the\\nbinary search algorithm, and the result, is a similarly eﬃci ent algorithm.\\nIn terms of asymptotic analysis (Section 8.6), searching, i nserting, and deleting in a binary'),\n",

F or example, if the items are i nserted into the tree in order of\\nincreasing size, then every item that is inserted moves alwa ys to the right as it moves down\\nthe tree. The result is a “tree” that looks more like a linked l ist, since it consists of a linear\\nstring of nodes strung together by their right child pointers. Operations on such a tree have\\nthe same performance as operations on a linked list. Now, the re are data structures that are\\nsimilar to simple binary sort trees, except that insertion a nd deletion of nodes are implemented\\nin a way that will always keep the tree balanced, or almost bal anced. F or these data structures,\\nsearching, inserting, and deleting have both average case a nd worst case run times that are\\nΘ(log(n)). Here, however, we will look at only the simple ver sions of inserting and searching.\\nThe sample program SortTreeDemo.java is a demonstration of binary sort trees. The pro-\\ngram includes subroutines that implement inorder traversa l, searching, and insertion. W e’ll\\nlook at the latter two subroutines below. The main() routine tests the subroutines by letting\\nyou type in strings to be inserted into the tree.\\nIn this program, nodes in the binary tree are represented usi ng the following static nested\\nclass, including a simple constructor that makes creating n odes easier:\\n/**\\n* An object of type TreeNode represents one node in a binary tree of strings.\\n*/\\nprivate static class TreeNode {\\nString item; // The data in this node.\\nTreeNode left; // Pointer to left subtree.\\nTreeNode right; // Pointer to right subtree.\\nTreeNode(String str) {\\n// Constructor. Make a node containing str.\\nitem = str;\\n}\\n} // end class TreeNode\\nA static member variable of type T reeNode points to the binary sort tree that is used by the\\nprogram:\\nprivate static TreeNode root; // Pointer to the root node in t he tree.\\n// When the tree is empty, root is null.\\nA recursive subroutine named treeContains is used to search for a given item in the tree. This\\nroutine implements the search algorithm for binary trees th at was outlined above:\\n/**\\n* Return true if item is one of the items in the binary\\n* sort tree to which root points. Return false if not.\\n*/\\nstatic boolean treeContains( TreeNode root, String item ) {\\nif ( root == null ) {\\n// Tree is empty, so it certainly doesn’t contain item.\\nreturn false;\\n}\\nelse if ( item.equals(root.item) ) {'),\n",

A simple, non-recursive\\nalgorithm for searching a binary sort tree follows the rule: Start at the root and move down the\\ntree until you ﬁnd the item or reach a null pointer. Since the s earch follows a single path down\\nthe tree, it can be implemented as a while loop. Here is non-recursive version of the search\\nroutine:\\nprivate static boolean treeContainsNR( TreeNode root, String item ) {\\nTreeNode runner; // For \"running\" down the tree.\\nrunner = root; // Start at the root node.\\nwhile (true) {\\nif (runner == null) {\\n// We’ve fallen off the tree without finding item.\\nreturn false;\\n}\\nelse if ( item.equals(node.item) ) {\\n// We’ve found the item.\\nreturn true;\\n}\\nelse if ( item.compareTo(node.item) < 0 ) {\\n// If the item occurs, it must be in the left subtree,\\n// So, advance the runner down one level to the left.\\nrunner = runner.left;\\n}\\nelse {\\n// If the item occurs, it must be in the right subtree.\\n// So, advance the runner down one level to the right.\\nrunner = runner.right;\\n}\\n} // end while\\n} // end treeContainsNR();\\nThe subroutine for inserting a new item into the tree turns ou t to be more similar to the\\nnon-recursive search routine than to the recursive. The ins ertion routine has to handle the case\\nwhere the tree is empty . In that case, the value of root must be changed to point to a node\\nthat contains the new item:\\nroot = new TreeNode( newItem );'),\n",

BINAR Y TREES 467\\n9.4.3 Expression T rees\\nAnother application of trees is to store mathematical expre ssions such as 15*(x+y) or\\nsqrt(42)+7 in a convenient form. Let’s stick for the moment to expressio ns made up of num-\\nbers and the operators +, -, *, and /. Consider the expression 3*((7+1)/4)+(17-5). This\\nexpression is made up of two subexpressions, 3*((7+1)/4) and (17-5), combined with the\\noperator “ +”. When the expression is represented as a binary tree, the ro ot node holds the\\noperator +, while the subtrees of the root node represent the subexpres sions 3*((7+1)/4) and\\n(17-5). Every node in the tree holds either a number or an operator. A node that holds a\\nnumber is a leaf node of the tree. A node that holds an operator has two subtrees representing\\nthe operands to which the operator applies. The tree is shown in the illustration below. I will\\nrefer to a tree of this type as an expression tree .\\nGiven an expression tree, it’s easy to ﬁnd the value of the exp ression that it represents. Each\\nnode in the tree has an associated value. If the node is a leaf n ode, then its value is simply the\\nnumber that the node contains. If the node contains an operat or, then the associated value is\\ncomputed by ﬁrst ﬁnding the values of its child nodes and then applying the operator to those\\nvalues. The process is shown by the upward-directed arrows i n the illustration. The value\\ncomputed for the root node is the value of the expression as a w hole. There are other uses for\\nexpression trees. F or example, a postorder traversal of the tree will output the postﬁx form of\\nthe expression.\\n1 73\\n4\\n7 1\\n5\\n6\\n1 2\\n3\\n4\\n1\\n7\\n1 7\\n5\\n1 8 a n s w e r\\nA t r e e t h a t r e p r e s e n t s\\nt h e e x p r e s s i o n\\n3 * ( ( 7 + 1 ) / 4 ) + ( 1 7 ¢ 5 )\\nT h e u p w a r d p o i n t i n g\\na r r o w s s h o w h o w t h e\\nv\\na l u e o f t h e e x p r e s s i o n\\nc\\na n b e\\nc\\no m p u t e d .\\n8\\n2\\nAn expression tree contains two types of nodes: nodes that co ntain numbers and nodes that\\ncontain operators. F urthermore, we might want to add other t ypes of nodes to make the trees\\nmore useful, such as nodes that contain variables. If we want to work with expression trees in\\nJava, how can we deal with this variety of nodes? One way—whic h will be frowned upon by\\nobject-oriented purists—is to include an instance variabl e in each node object to record which\\ntype of node it is:\\nenum NodeType { NUMBER, OPERATOR } // Possible kinds of node.'),\n",

There are ma ny diﬃcult questions about how\\nlanguages can convey information, how they are structured, and how they can be processed.\\nNatural and artiﬁcial languages are similar enough that the study of programming languages,\\nwhich are pretty well understood, can give some insight into the much more complex and\\ndiﬃcult natural languages. And programming languages rais e more than enough interesting\\nissues to make them worth studying in their own right. How can it be, after all, that computers\\ncan be made to “understand” even the relatively simple langu ages that are used to write\\nprograms? Computers, after all, can only directly use instr uctions expressed in very simple\\nmachine language. Higher level languages must be translate d into machine language. But\\nthe translation is done by a compiler, which is just a program . How could such a translation\\nprogram be written?\\n9.5.1 Backus-Naur F orm\\nNatural and artiﬁcial languages are similar in that they hav e a structure known as grammar\\nor syntax. Syntax can be expressed by a set of rules that descr ibe what it means to be a legal\\nsentence or program. F or programming languages, syntax rul es are often expressed in BNF\\n(Backus-Naur F orm), a system that was developed by computer scientists John Backus and\\nPeter Naur in the late 1950s. Interestingly , an equivalent s ystem was developed independently\\nat about the same time by linguist Noam Chomsky to describe th e grammar of natural language.\\nBNF cannot express all possible syntax rules. F or example, i t can’t express the fact that a\\nvariable must be deﬁned before it is used. F urthermore, it sa ys nothing about the meaning or\\nsemantics of the langauge. The problem of specifying the sem antics of a language—even of an\\nartiﬁcial programming langauge—is one that is still far fro m being completely solved. However,\\nBNF does express the basic structure of the language, and it p lays a central role in the design\\nof translation programs.\\nIn English, terms such as “noun”, “transitive verb,” and “pr epositional phrase” are syntac-\\ntic categories that describe building blocks of sentences. Similarly , “st atement”, “number,”\\nand “while loop” are syntactic categories that describe bui lding blocks of Java programs. In\\nBNF, a syntactic category is written as a word enclosed betwe en “ <” and ” >”. F or example:\\n<noun>, <verb-phrase>, or <while-loop>. A rule in BNF speciﬁes the structure of an item'),\n",

A SIMPLE RECURSIVE DESCENT P ARSER 471\\nin a given syntactic category , in terms of other syntactic ca tegories and/or basic symbols of the\\nlanguage. F or example, one BNF rule for the English language might be\\n<sentence> ::= <noun-phrase> <verb-phrase>\\nThe symbol “ ::=” is read “can be”, so this rule says that a <sentence> can be a <noun-phrase>\\nfollowed by a <verb-phrase>. (The term is “can be” rather than “is” because there might be\\nother rules that specify other possible forms for a sentence .) This rule can be thought of as a\\nrecipe for a sentence: If you want to make a sentence, make a no un-phrase and follow it by a\\nverb-phrase. Noun-phrase and verb-phrase must, in turn, be deﬁned by other BNF rules.\\nIn BNF, a choice between alternatives is represented by the s ymbol “ |”, which is read “or”.\\nF or example, the rule\\n<verb-phrase> ::= <intransitive-verb> |\\n( <transitive-verb> <noun-phrase> )\\nsays that a <verb-phrase> can be an <intransitive-verb>, or a <transitive-verb> followed\\nby a <noun-phrase>. Note also that parentheses can be used for grouping. T o expr ess the fact\\nthat an item is optional, it can be enclosed between “ [” and “ ]”. An optional item that can\\nbe repeated one or more times is enclosed between “ [” and “ ]...”. And a symbol that is an\\nactual part of the language that is being described is enclos ed in quotes. F or example,\\n<noun-phrase> ::= <common-noun> [ \"that\" <verb-phrase> ] |\\n<common-noun> [ <prepositional-phrase> ]...\\nsays that a <noun-phrase> can be a <common-noun>, optionally followed by the literal word\\n“ that” and a <verb-phrase>, or it can be a <common-noun> followed by zero or more\\n<prepositional-phrase>’s. Obviously , we can describe very complex structures in this way .\\nThe real power comes from the fact that BNF rules can be recursive. In fact, the two pre-\\nceding rules, taken together, are recursive. A <noun-phrase> is deﬁned partly in terms of\\n<verb-phrase>, while <verb-phrase> is deﬁned partly in terms of <noun-phrase>. F or ex-\\nample, a <noun-phrase> might be “the rat that ate the cheese”, since “ate the cheese” is a\\n<verb-phrase>. But then we can, recursively , make the more complex <noun-phrase> “the cat\\nthat caught the rat that ate the cheese” out of the <common-noun> “the cat”, the word “that”\\nand the <verb-phrase> “caught the rat that ate the cheese”. Building from there, we can make\\nthe <noun-phrase> “the dog that chased the cat that caught the rat that ate the ch eese”. The\\nrecursive structure of language is one of the most fundament al properties of language, and the\\nability of BNF to express this recursive structure is what ma kes it so useful.\\nBNF can be used to describe the syntax of a programming langua ge such as Java in a formal\\nand precise way . F or example, a <while-loop> can be deﬁned as\\n<while-loop> ::= \"while\" \"(\" <condition> \")\" <statement>\\nThis says that a <while-loop> consists of the word “while”, followed by a left parenthesis ,\\nfollowed by a <condition>, followed by a right parenthesis, followed by a <statement>. Of\\ncourse, it still remains to deﬁne what is meant by a condition and by a statement. Since a\\nstatement can be, among other things, a while loop, we can already see the recursive structure\\nof the Java language. The exact speciﬁcation of an if statement, which is hard to express\\nclearly in words, can be given as\\n<if-statement> ::=\\n\"if\" \"(\" <condition> \")\" <statement>\\n[ \"else\" \"if\" \"(\" <condition> \")\" <statement> ]...\\n[ \"else\" <statement> ]'),\n",

LINKED DA T A STRUCTURES AND RECURSION\\nThis rule makes it clear that the “ else” part is optional and that there can be, optionally , one\\nor more “ else if” parts.\\n9.5.2 Recursive Descent Parsing\\nIn the rest of this section, I will show how a BNF grammar for a l anguage can be used as a guide\\nfor constructing a parser. A parser is a program that determi nes the grammatical structure of a\\nphrase in the language. This is the ﬁrst step to determining t he meaning of the phrase—which\\nfor a programming language means translating it into machin e language. Although we will look\\nat only a simple example, I hope it will be enough to convince y ou that compilers can in fact\\nbe written and understood by mortals and to give you some idea of how that can be done.\\nThe parsing method that we will use is called recursive descent parsing . It is not the\\nonly possible parsing method, or the most eﬃcient, but it is t he one most suited for writing\\ncompilers by hand (rather than with the help of so called “par ser generator” programs). In a\\nrecursive descent parser, every rule of the BNF grammar is th e model for a subroutine. Not\\nevery BNF grammar is suitable for recursive descent parsing . The grammar must satisfy a\\ncertain property . Essentially , while parsing a phrase, it m ust be possible to tell what syntactic\\ncategory is coming up next just by looking at the next item in t he input. Many grammars are\\ndesigned with this property in mind.\\nI should also mention that many variations of BNF are in use. T he one that I’ve described\\nhere is one that is well-suited for recursive descent parsin g.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nWhen we try to parse a phrase that contains a syntax error, we n eed some way to respond\\nto the error. A convenient way of doing this is to throw an exce ption. I’ll use an exception\\nclass called ParseError, deﬁned as follows:\\n/**\\n* An object of type ParseError represents a syntax error found in\\n* the user’s input.\\n*/\\nprivate static class ParseError extends Exception {\\nParseError(String message) {\\nsuper(message);\\n}\\n} // end nested class ParseError\\nAnother general point is that our BNF rules don’t say anythin g about spaces between items,\\nbut in reality we want to be able to insert spaces between item s at will. T o allow for this, I’ll\\nalways call the routine TextIO.skipBlanks() before trying to look ahead to see what’s coming\\nup next in input. TextIO.skipBlanks() skips past any whitespace, such as spaces and tabs,\\nin the input, and stops when the next character in the input is either a non-blank character or\\nthe end-of-line character.\\nLet’s start with a very simple example. A “fully parenthesiz ed expression” can be speciﬁed\\nin BNF by the rules\\n<expression> ::= <number> |\\n\"(\" <expression> <operator> <expression> \")\"\\n<operator> ::= \"+\" | \"-\" | \"*\" | \"/\"'),\n",

Since every operator corresponds to a pair of parenthe-\\nses, there is no ambiguity about the order in which the operat ors are to be applied. Suppose\\nwe want a program that will read and evaluate such expression s. W e’ll read the expressions\\nfrom standard input, using T extIO.

I use TextIO.peek() to look ahead at the next character before I\\nread it, and I call TextIO.skipBlanks() before testing TextIO.peek() in order to ignore any\\nblanks that separate items. I will follow this same pattern i n every case.\\nWhen we come to the subroutine for <expression>, things are a little more interesting. The\\nrule says that an expression can be either a number or an expre ssion enclosed in parentheses.\\nW e can tell which it is by looking ahead at the next character. If the character is a digit,\\nwe have to read a number. If the character is a “(“, we have to re ad the “(“, followed by an\\nexpression, followed by an operator, followed by another ex pression, followed by a “)”. If the\\nnext character is anything else, there is an error. Note that we need recursion to read the\\nnested expressions. The routine doesn’t just read the expre ssion. It also computes and returns\\nits value. This requires semantical information that is not speciﬁed in the BNF rule.\\n/**\\n* Read an expression from the current line of input and return its value.\\n* @throws ParseError if the input contains a syntax error\\n*/\\nprivate static double expressionValue() throws ParseError {\\nTextIO.skipBlanks();\\nif ( Character.isDigit(TextIO.peek()) ) {\\n// The next item in input is a number, so the expression\\n// must consist of just that number.

T o complicate things a bit more, we allow for leading minus signs in\\nexpressions, as in “ -(3+4)” or “ -7”. (Since a <number> is a positive number, this is the only\\nway we can get negative numbers. It’s done this way to avoid “ 3 * -7”, for example.) This\\nstructure can be expressed by the BNF rules\\n<expression> ::= [ \"-\" ] <term> [ ( \"+\" | \"-\" ) <term> ]...\\n<term> ::= <factor> [ ( \"*\" | \"/\" ) <factor> ]...\\n<factor> ::= <number> | \"(\" <expression> \")\"\\nThe ﬁrst rule uses the “ [ ]...” notation, which says that the items that it encloses can\\noccur zero, one, two, or more times.

What does tha t have to do with translating\\nprograms into machine language? W ell, instead of actually e valuating the expression, it would\\nbe almost as easy to generate the machine language instructi ons that are needed to evaluate\\nthe expression. If we are working with a “stack machine”, the se instructions would be stack\\noperations such as “push a number” or “apply a + operation”. The program SimpleParser3.java\\ncan both evaluate the expression and print a list of stack mac hine operations for evaluating the\\nexpression.\\nIt’s quite a jump from this program to a recursive descent par ser that can read a program\\nwritten in Java and generate the equivalent machine languag e code—but the conceptual leap\\nis not huge.\\nThe SimpleParser3 program doesn’t actually generate the stack operations dir ectly as it\\nparses an expression. Instead, it builds an expression tree , as discussed in the Section 9.4,\\nto represent the expression. The expression tree is then use d to ﬁnd the value and to gen-\\nerate the stack operations. The tree is made up of nodes belon ging to classes ConstNode\\nand BinOpNode that are similar to those given in the Section 9.4. Another cl ass, UnaryMi-\\nnusNode, has been introduced to represent the unary minus operation . I’ve added a method,\\nprintStackCommands(), to each class. This method is responsible for printing out t he stack\\noperations that are necessary to evaluate an expression. He re for example is the new BinOpNode\\nclass from SimpleParser3.java:\\nprivate static class BinOpNode extends ExpNode {\\nchar op; // The operator.\\nExpNode left; // The expression for its left operand.\\nExpNode right; // The expression for its right operand.\\nBinOpNode(char op, ExpNode left, ExpNode right) {\\n// Construct a BinOpNode containing the specified data.\\nassert op == ’+’ || op == ’-’ || op == ’*’ || op == ’/’;\\nassert left != null && right != null;\\nthis.op = op;\\nthis.left = left;\\nthis.right = right;\\n}\\ndouble value() {\\n// The value is obtained by evaluating the left and right\\n// operands and combining the values with the operator.\\ndouble x = left.value();\\ndouble y = right.value();\\nswitch (op) {\\ncase ’+’:\\nreturn x + y;\\ncase ’-’:\\nreturn x - y;\\ncase ’*’:\\nreturn x * y;\\ncase ’/’:\\nreturn x / y;\\ndefault:\\nreturn Double.NaN; // Bad operator!\\n}\\n}'),\n",

In Subsection 9.4.2, I say that “if the [binary sort] tree is c reated by inserting items in a\\nrandom order, there is a high probability that the tree is app roximately balanced.” F or\\nthis exercise, you will do an experiment to test whether that is true.\\nThe depth of a node in a binary tree is the length of the path from the root of the tree\\nto that node. That is, the root has depth 0, its children have d epth 1, its grandchildren\\nhave depth 2, and so on. In a balanced tree, all the leaves in th e tree are about the same\\ndepth. F or example, in a perfectly balanced tree with 1023 no des, all the leaves are at\\ndepth 9. In an approximately balanced tree with 1023 nodes, t he average depth of all the\\nleaves should be not too much bigger than 9.\\nOn the other hand, even if the tree is approximately balanced , there might be a few\\nleaves that have much larger depth than the average, so we mig ht also want to look at the\\nmaximum depth among all the leaves in a tree.\\nF or this exercise, you should create a random binary sort tre e with 1023 nodes. The\\nitems in the tree can be real numbers, and you can create the tr ee by generating 1023\\nrandom real numbers and inserting them into the tree, using t he usual treeInsert()\\nmethod for binary sort trees. Once you have the tree, you shou ld compute and output the\\naverage depth of all the leaves in the tree and the maximum dep th of all the leaves. T o\\ndo this, you will need three recursive subroutines: one to co unt the leaves, one to ﬁnd the\\nsum of the depths of all the leaves, and one to ﬁnd the maximum d epth. The latter two\\nsubroutines should have an int-valued parameter, depth, that tells how deep in the tree\\nyou’ve gone. When you call this routine from the main program , the depth parameter is\\n0; when you call the routine recursively , the parameter incr eases by 1.\\n6. The parsing programs in Section 9.5 work with expressions ma de up of numbers and\\noperators. W e can make things a little more interesting by al lowing the variable “x” to\\noccur. This would allow expression such as “ 3*(x-1)*(x+1)”, for example. Make a new\\nversion of the sample program SimpleParser3.java that can work with such expressions.\\nIn your program, the main() routine can’t simply print the value of the expression, sinc e\\nthe value of the expression now depends on the value of x. Instead, it should print the\\nvalue of the expression for x=0, x=1, x=2, and x=3.\\nThe original program will have to be modiﬁed in several other ways. Currently , the\\nprogram uses classes ConstNode, BinOpNode, and UnaryMinusNode to represent nodes\\nin an expression tree. Since expressions can now include x, you will need a new class,\\nVariableNode, to represent an occurrence of x in the expression.\\nIn the original program, each of the node classes has an insta nce method,\\n“ double value()”, which returns the value of the node. But in your program, th e\\nvalue can depend on x, so you should replace this method with one of the form\\n“ double value(double xValue)”, where the parameter xValue is the value of x.\\nFinally , the parsing subroutines in your program will have t o take into account the\\nfact that expressions can contain x. There is just one small change in the BNF rules for\\nthe expressions: A <factor> is allowed to be the variable x:\\n<factor> ::= <number> | <x-variable> | \"(\" <expression> \")\"'),\n",

T o understand it, you should\\nhave some background in Calculus. The derivative of an expre ssion that involves the\\nvariable x can be deﬁned by a few recursive rules:\\n• The derivative of a constant is 0.\\n• The derivative of x is 1.\\n• If A is an expression, let dA be the derivative of A. Then the derivative of -A is -dA.\\n• If A and B are expressions, let dA be the derivative of A and let dB be the derivative\\nof B.

Y ou can do thi s by adding a derivative-\\ncomputing method to each of the node classes. First, add anot her abstract method to the\\nExpNode class:\\nabstract ExpNode derivative();\\nThen implement this method in each of the four subclasses of ExpNode. All the information\\nthat you need is in the rules given above. In your main program , instead of printing the\\nstack operations for the original expression, you should pr int out the stack operations\\nthat deﬁne the derivative. Note that the formula that you get for the derivative can be\\nmuch more complicated than it needs to be. F or example, the de rivative of 3*x+1 will be\\ncomputed as (3*1+0*x)+0. This is correct, even though it’s kind of ugly , and it would b e\\nnice for it to be simpliﬁed. However, simplifying expressio ns is not easy .\\nAs an alternative to printing out stack operations, you migh t want to print the deriva-\\ntive as a fully parenthesized expression. Y ou can do this by a dding a printInfix() routine\\nto each node class. It would be nice to leave out unnecessary p arentheses, but again, the\\nproblem of deciding which parentheses can be left out withou t altering the meaning of the\\nexpression is a fairly diﬃcult one, which I don’t advise you t o attempt.\\n(There is one curious thing that happens here: If you apply th e rules, as given, to an\\nexpression tree, the result is no longer a tree, since the sam e subexpression can occur at\\nmultiple points in the derivative. F or example, if you build a node to represent B*B by\\nsaying “ new BinOpNode(’*’,B,B)”, then the left and right children of the new node are\\nactually the same node! This is not allowed in a tree. However , the diﬀerence is harmless\\nin this case since, like a tree, the structure that you get has no loops in it. Loops, on the\\nother hand, would be a disaster in most of the recursive tree- processing subroutines that\\nwe have written, since it would lead to inﬁnite recursion.)'),\n",

Many data structures and algorithms, such as\\nthose from Chapter 9, have been studied, programmed, and re- programmed by generations of\\ncomputer science students. This is a valuable learning expe rience. Unfortunately , they have\\nalso been programmed and re-programmed by generations of wo rking computer professionals,\\ntaking up time that could be devoted to new, more creative wor k. A programmer who needs\\na list or a binary tree shouldn’t have to re-code these data st ructures from scratch. They are\\nwell-understood and have been programmed thousands of time s before. The problem is how to\\nmake pre-written, robust data structures available to prog rammers. In this chapter, we’ll look\\nat Java’s attempt to address this problem.\\n10.1 Generic Programming\\nGeneric programming refers to writing code that will work for many types of data. W e\\nencountered the term in Section 7.3, where we looked at dynam ic arrays of integers. The\\nsource code presented there for working with dynamic arrays of integers works only for data\\nof type int. But the source code for dynamic arrays of double, String, JButton, or any other\\ntype would be almost identical, except for the substitution of one type name for another. It\\nseems silly to write essentially the same code over and over. As we saw in Subsection 7.3.3,\\nJava goes some distance towards solving this problem by prov iding the ArrayList class. An\\nArrayList is essentially a dynamic array of values of type Object. Since every class is a subclass\\nof Object, objects of any type can be stored in an ArrayList. Java goes even further by providing\\n“parameterized types,” which were introduced in Subsectio n 7.3.4. There we saw that the\\nArrayList type can be parameterized, as in “ ArrayList<String>”, to limit the values that can\\nbe stored in the list to objects of a speciﬁed type. Parameter ized types extend Java’s basic\\nphilosophy of type-safe programming to generic programmin g.\\nThe ArrayList class is just one of several standard classes that are used fo r generic pro-\\ngramming in Java. W e will spend the next few sections looking at these classes and how they\\nare used, and we’ll see that there are also generic methods an d generic interfaces (see Subsec-\\ntion 5.7.1). All the classes and interfaces discussed in the se sections are deﬁned in the package\\njava.util, and you will need an import statement at the beginning of you r program to get\\naccess to them. (Before you start putting “ import java.util.*” at the beginning of every\\nprogram, you should know that some things in java.util have names that are the same as\\n485'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\nthings in other packages. F or example, both java.util.List and java.awt.List exist, so it\\nis often better to import the individual classes that you nee d.)\\nIn the ﬁnal section of this chapter, we will see that it is poss ible to deﬁne new generic classes,\\ninterfaces, and methods. Until then, we will stick to using t he generics that are predeﬁned in\\nJava’s standard library .\\nIt is no easy task to design a library for generic programming . Java’s solution has many\\nnice features but is certainly not the only possible approac h. It is almost certainly not the\\nbest, and has a few features that in my opinion can only be call ed bizarre, but in the context\\nof the overall design of Java, it might be close to optimal. T o get some perspective on generic\\nprogramming in general, it might be useful to look very brieﬂ y at generic programming in two\\nother languages.\\n10.1.1 Generic Programming in Smalltalk\\nSmalltalk was one of the very ﬁrst object-oriented programm ing languages. It is still used today ,\\nalthough its use is not very common. It has not achieved anyth ing like the popularity of Java\\nor C++, but it is the source of many ideas used in these languag es. In Smalltalk, essentially\\nall programming is generic, because of two basic properties of the language.\\nFirst of all, variables in Smalltalk are typeless. A data val ue has a type, such as integer or\\nstring, but variables do not have types. Any variable can hol d data of any type. Parameters\\nare also typeless, so a subroutine can be applied to paramete r values of any type. Similarly ,\\na data structure can hold data values of any type. F or example , once you’ve deﬁned a binary\\ntree data structure in SmallT alk, you can use it for binary tr ees of integers or strings or dates\\nor data of any other type. There is simply no need to write new c ode for each data type.\\nSecondly , all data values are objects, and all operations on objects are deﬁned by methods\\nin a class. This is true even for types that are “primitive” in Java, such as integers. When the\\n“ +” operator is used to add two integers, the operation is perfo rmed by calling a method in the\\ninteger class. When you deﬁne a new class, you can deﬁne a “ +” operator, and you will then\\nbe able to add objects belonging to that class by saying “ a + b” just as if you were adding\\nnumbers. Now, suppose that you write a subroutine that uses t he “ +” operator to add up the\\nitems in a list. The subroutine can be applied to a list of inte gers, but it can also be applied,\\nautomatically , to any other data type for which “ +” is deﬁned. Similarly , a subroutine that\\nuses the “ <\" operator to sort a list can be applied to lists containing any type of data for which\\n“ <” is deﬁned. There is no need to write a diﬀerent sorting subro utine for each type of data.\\nPut these two features together and you have a language where data structures and al-\\ngorithms will work for any type of data for which they make sen se, that is, for which the\\nappropriate operations are deﬁned. This is real generic pro gramming. This might sound pretty\\ngood, and you might be asking yourself why all programming la nguages don’t work this way .\\nThis type of freedom makes it easier to write programs, but un fortunately it makes it harder\\nto write programs that are correct and robust (see Chapter 8) . Once you have a data structure\\nthat can contain data of any type, it becomes hard to ensure th at it only holds the type of\\ndata that you want it to hold. If you have a subroutine that can sort any type of data, it’s\\nhard to ensure that it will only be applied to data for which th e “ <” operator is deﬁned. More\\nparticularly , there is no way for a compiler to ensure these things. The problem will only show\\nup at run time when an attempt is made to apply some operation t o a data type for which it\\nis not deﬁned, and the program will crash.'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING 487\\n10.1.2 Generic Programming in C++\\nUnlike Smalltalk, C++ is a very strongly typed language, eve n more so than Java. Every\\nvariable has a type, and can only hold data values of that type . This means that the kind\\nof generic programming that is used in Smalltalk is impossib le in C++. F urthermore, C++\\ndoes not have anything corresponding to Java’s Object class. That is, there is no class that\\nis a superclass of all other classes. This means that C++ can’ t use Java’s style of generic\\nprogramming with non-parameterized generic types either. Nevertheless, C++ has a powerful\\nand ﬂexible system of generic programming. It is made possib le by a language feature known\\nas templates. In C++, instead of writing a diﬀerent sorting subroutine fo r each type of data,\\nyou can write a single subroutine template. The template is n ot a subroutine; it’s more like a\\nfactory for making subroutines. W e can look at an example, si nce the syntax of C++ is very\\nsimilar to Java’s:\\ntemplate<class ItemType>\\nvoid sort( ItemType A[], int count ) {\\n// Sort items in the array, A, into increasing order.\\n// The items in positions 0, 1, 2, ..., (count-1) are sorted.\\n// The algorithm that is used here is selection sort.\\nfor (int i = count-1; i > 0; i--) {\\nint position\\nof max = 0;\\nfor (int j = 1; j <= count ; j++)\\nif ( A[j] > A[position of max] )\\nposition of max = j;\\nItemType temp = A[count];\\nA[count] = A[position\\nof max];\\nA[position of max] = temp;\\n}\\n}\\nThis piece of code deﬁnes a subroutine template. If you remov e the ﬁrst line, “template <class\\nItemType>”, and substitute the word “int” for the word “ItemType” in th e rest of the template,\\nyou get a subroutine for sorting arrays of ints. (Even though it says “class ItemType”, you\\ncan actually substitute any type for ItemType, including th e primitive types.) If you substitute\\n“string” for “ItemType”, you get a subroutine for sorting ar rays of strings. This is pretty much\\nwhat the compiler does with the template. If your program say s “ sort(list,10)” where list\\nis an array of ints, the compiler uses the template to generate a subroutine for sorting arrays\\nof ints. If you say “ sort(cards,10)” where cards is an array of objects of type Card, then the\\ncompiler generates a subroutine for sorting arrays of Cards. At least, it tries to. The template\\nuses the “ >” operator to compare values. If this operator is deﬁned for v alues of type Card, then\\nthe compiler will successfully use the template to generate a subroutine for sorting cards. If\\n“ >” is not deﬁned for Cards, then the compiler will fail—but this will happen at compile time,\\nnot, as in Smalltalk, at run time where it would make the progr am crash.\\nIn addition to subroutine templates, C++ also has templates for making classes. If you\\nwrite a template for a binary tree class, you can use it to gene rate classes for binary trees of\\nints, binary trees of strings, binary trees of dates, and so on—al l from one template. The most\\nrecent version of C++ comes with a large number of pre-writte n templates called the Standard\\nTemplate Library or STL. The STL is quite complex. Many people would say that it s much\\ntoo complex. But it is also one of the most interesting featur es of C++.'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\n10.1.3 Generic Programming in Java\\nJava’s generic programming features have gone through seve ral stages of development. The\\noriginal version of Java had just a few generic data structur e classes, such as Vector, that could\\nhold values of type Object. Java version 1.2 introduced a much larger group of generics that\\nfollowed the same basic model. These generic classes and int erfaces as a group are known as\\nthe Java Collection Framework . The ArrayList class is part of the Collection F ramework.\\nThe original Collection F ramework was closer in spirit to Sm alltalk than it was to C++, since\\na data structure designed to hold Objects can be used with objects of any type. Unfortunately ,\\nas in Smalltalk, the result is a category of errors that show u p only at run time, rather than\\nat compile time. If a programmer assumes that all the items in a data structure are strings\\nand tries to process those items as strings, a run-time error will occur if other types of data\\nhave inadvertently been added to the data structure. In Java , the error will most likely occur\\nwhen the program retrieves an Object from the data structure and tries to type-cast it to type\\nString. If the object is not actually of type String, the illegal type-cast will throw an error of\\ntype ClassCastException.\\nJava 5.0 introduced parameterized types, such as ArrayList<String>. This made it possible to\\ncreate generic data structures that can be type-checked at c ompile time rather than at run time.\\nWith these data structures, type-casting is not necessary , so ClassCastExceptions are avoided.\\nThe compiler will detect any attempt to add an object of the wr ong type to the data structure;\\nit will report a syntax error and will refuse to compile the pr ogram. In Java 5.0, all of the\\nclasses and interfaces in the Collection F ramework, and eve n some classes that are not part of\\nthat framework, have been parameterized. Java’s parameter ized classes are similar to template\\nclasses in C++ (although the implementation is very diﬀeren t), and their introduction moves\\nJava’s generic programming model closer to C++ and farther f rom Smalltalk. In this chapter,\\nI will use the parameterized types almost exclusively , but y ou should remember that their use\\nis not mandatory . It is still legal to use a parameterized cla ss as a non-parameterized type,\\nsuch as a plain ArrayList.\\nNote that there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between parameter ized classes in Java and tem-\\nplate classes in C++. A template class in C++ is not really a cl ass at all—it’s a kind of factory\\nfor generating classes. Every time the template is used with a new type, a new compiled class\\nis created. With a Java parameterized class, there is only on e compiled class ﬁle. F or example,\\nthere is only one compiled class ﬁle, ArrayList.class, for the parameterized class ArrayList.\\nThe parameterized types ArrayList<String> and ArrayList<Integer> both use the some compiled\\nclass ﬁle, as does the plain ArrayList type. The type parameter— String or Integer —just tells the\\ncompiler to limit the type of object that can be stored in the d ata structure. The type parame-\\nter has no eﬀect at run time and is not even known at run time. Th e type information is said to\\nbe “erased” at run time. This type erasuer introduces a certain amount of weirdness. F or ex-\\nample, you can’t test “ if (list instanceof ArrayList<String>)” because the instanceof\\noperator is evaluated at run time, and at run time only the pla in ArrayList exists. Even worse,\\nyou can’t create an array that has base type ArrayList<String> by using the new operator, as in\\n“ new ArrayList<String>[N]”. This is because the new operator is evaluated at run time, and\\nat run time there is no such thing as “ ArrayList<String>”; only the non-parameterized type\\nArrayList exists at run time.\\nF ortunately , most programmers don’t have to deal with such p roblems, since they turn up\\nonly in fairly advanced programming. Most people who use the Java Collection F ramework will\\nnot encounter them, and they will get the beneﬁts of type-saf e generic programming with little\\ndiﬃculty .'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING 489\\n10.1.4 The Java Collection F ramework\\nJava’s generic data structures can be divided into two categ ories: collections and maps. A\\ncollection is more or less what it sound like: a collection of objects. A map associates objects\\nin one set with objects in another set in the way that a diction ary associates deﬁnitions with\\nwords or a phone book associates phone numbers with names. A m ap is similar to what I called\\nan “association list” in Subsection 7.4.2. In Java, collect ions and maps are represented by the\\nparameterized interfaces Collection<T> and Map<T,S>. Here, “T” and “S” stand for any type\\nexcept for the primitive types. Map<T,S> is the ﬁrst example we have seen where there are two\\ntype parameters, T and S ; we will not deal further with this possibility until we look at maps\\nmore closely in Section 10.3. In this section and the next, we look at collections only .\\nThere are two types of collections: lists and sets. A list is a collection in which the objects\\nare arranged in a linear sequence. A list has a ﬁrst item, a sec ond item, and so on. F or any\\nitem in the list, except the last, there is an item that direct ly follows it. The deﬁning property\\nof a set is that no object can occur more than once in a set; the e lements of a set are not neces-\\nsarily thought of as being in any particular order. The ideas of lists and sets are represented as\\nparameterized interfaces List<T> and Set<T>. These are sub-interfaces of Collection<T>. That\\nis, any object that implements the interface List<T> or Set<T> automatically implements Col-\\nlection<T> as well. The interface Collection<T> speciﬁes general operations that can be applied\\nto any collection at all. List<T> and Set<T> add additional operations that are appropriate for\\nlists and sets respectively .\\nOf course, any actual object that is a collection, list, or se t must belong to a concrete class\\nthat implements the corresponding interface. F or example, the class ArrayList<T> implements\\nthe interface List<T> and therefore also implements Collection<T>. This means that all the\\nmethods that are deﬁned in the list and collection interface s can be used with, for example,\\nan ArrayList<String> object. W e will look at various classes that implement the li st and set\\ninterfaces in the next section. But before we do that, we’ll l ook brieﬂy at some of the general\\noperations that are available for all collections.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe interface Collection<T> speciﬁes methods for performing some basic operations on an y\\ncollection of objects. Since “collection” is a very general concept, operations that can be applied\\nto all collections are also very general. They are generic op erations in the sense that they can\\nbe applied to various types of collections containing vario us types of objects. Suppose that\\ncoll is an object that implements the interface Collection<T> (for some speciﬁc non-primitive\\ntype T ). Then the following operations, which are speciﬁed in the i nterface Collection<T>, are\\ndeﬁned for coll:\\n• coll.size() — returns an int that gives the number of objects in the collection.\\n• coll.isEmpty() — returns a boolean value which is true if the size of the collection is 0.\\n• coll.clear() — removes all objects from the collection.\\n• coll.add(tobject) — adds tobject to the collection. The parameter must be of type T ;\\nif not, a syntax error occurs at compile time. This method ret urns a boolean value which\\ntells you whether the operation actually modiﬁed the collec tion. F or example, adding an\\nobject to a Set has no eﬀect if that object was already in the set.\\n• coll.contains(object) — returns a boolean value that is true if object is in the\\ncollection. Note that object is not required to be of type T, since it makes sense to\\ncheck whether object is in the collection, no matter what type object has. (F or testing'),\n",

The criterion for testin g non-null objects\\nfor equality can diﬀer from one kind of collection to another ; see Subsection 10.1.6, below.)\\n• coll.remove(object) — removes object from the collection, if it occurs in the collection,\\nand returns a boolean value that tells you whether the object was found. Again, object\\nis not required to be of type T.\\n• coll.containsAll(coll2) — returns a boolean value that is true if every object in\\ncoll2 is also in the coll. The parameter can be any collection.\\n• coll.addAll(coll2) — adds all the objects in coll2 to coll. The parameter, coll2,\\ncan be any collection of type Collection<T>. However, it can also be more general. F or\\nexample, if T is a class and S is a sub-class of T, then coll2 can be of type Collection<S>.\\nThis makes sense because any object of type S is automatically of type T and so can\\nlegally be added to coll.\\n• coll.removeAll(coll2) — removes every object from coll that also occurs in the\\ncollection coll2. coll2 can be any collection.\\n• coll.retainAll(coll2) — removes every object from coll that does not occur in\\nthe collection coll2. It “retains” only the objects that do occur in coll2. coll2 can be\\nany collection.\\n• coll.toArray() — returns an array of type Object[ ] that contains all the items in the\\ncollection. The return value can be type-cast to another arr ay type, if appropriate. Note\\nthat the return type is Object[ ], not T[ ]! However, you can type-cast the return value to a\\nmore speciﬁc type. F or example, if you know that all the items in coll are of type String,\\nthen (String[])coll.toArray() gives you an array of Strings containing all the strings\\nin the collection.\\nSince these methods are part of the Collection<T> interface, they must be deﬁned for every\\nobject that implements that interface. There is a problem wi th this, however. F or example,\\nthe size of some kinds of collection cannot be changed after t hey are created. Methods that\\nadd or remove objects don’t make sense for these collections . While it is still legal to call the\\nmethods, an exception will be thrown when the call is evaluat ed at run time. The type of\\nthe exception is UnsupportedOperationException. F urthermore, since Collection<T> is only an\\ninterface, not a concrete class, the actual implementation of the method is left to the classes\\nthat implement the interface. This means that the semantics of the methods, as described\\nabove, are not guaranteed to be valid for all collection obje cts; they are valid, however, for\\nclasses in the Java Collection F ramework.\\nThere is also the question of eﬃciency . Even when an operatio n is deﬁned for several types of\\ncollections, it might not be equally eﬃcient in all cases. Ev en a method as simple as size() can\\nvary greatly in eﬃciency . F or some collections, computing t he size() might involve counting\\nthe items in the collection. The number of steps in this proce ss is equal to the number of items.\\nOther collections might have instance variables to keep tra ck of the size, so evaluating size()\\njust means returning the value of a variable. In this case, th e computation takes only one step,\\nno matter how many items there are. When working with collect ions, it’s good to have some\\nidea of how eﬃcient operations are and to choose a collection for which the operations that you\\nneed can be implemented most eﬃciently . W e’ll see speciﬁc ex amples of this in the next two\\nsections.'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING 491\\n10.1.5 Iterators and for-each Loops\\nThe interface Collection<T> deﬁnes a few basic generic algorithms, but suppose you want t o\\nwrite your own generic algorithms. Suppose, for example, yo u want to do something as simple\\nas printing out every item in a collection. T o do this in a gene ric way , you need some way of\\ngoing through an arbitrary collection, accessing each item in turn. W e have seen how to do this\\nfor speciﬁc data structures: F or an array , you can use a for loop to iterate through all the array\\nindices. F or a linked list, you can use a while loop in which yo u advance a pointer along the list.\\nF or a binary tree, you can use a recursive subroutine to do an i nﬁx traversal. Collections can\\nbe represented in any of these forms and many others besides. With such a variety of traversal\\nmechanisms, how can we even hope to come up with a single gener ic method that will work for\\ncollections that are stored in wildly diﬀerent forms? This p roblem is solved by iterators. An\\niterator is an object that can be used to traverse a collectio n. Diﬀerent types of collections have\\niterators that are implemented in diﬀerent ways, but all ite rators are used in the same way . An\\nalgorithm that uses an iterator to traverse a collection is g eneric, because the same technique\\ncan be applied to any type of collection. Iterators can seem r ather strange to someone who\\nis encountering generic programming for the ﬁrst time, but y ou should understand that they\\nsolve a diﬃcult problem in an elegant way .\\nThe interface Collection<T> deﬁnes a method that can be used to obtain an iterator for any\\ncollection. If coll is a collection, then coll.iterator() returns an iterator that can be used\\nto traverse the collection. Y ou should think of the iterator as a kind of generalized pointer that\\nstarts at the beginning of the collection and can move along t he collection from one item to the\\nnext. Iterators are deﬁned by a parameterized interface nam ed Iterator<T>. If coll implements\\nthe interface Collection<T> for some speciﬁc type T, then coll.iterator() returns an iterator\\nof type Iterator<T>, with the same type T as its type parameter. The interface Iterator<T>\\ndeﬁnes just three methods. If iter refers to an object that implements Iterator<T>, then we\\nhave:\\n• iter.next() — returns the next item, and advances the iterator. The retur n value is of\\ntype T. This method lets you look at one of the items in the collectio n. Note that there is\\nno way to look at an item without advancing the iterator past t hat item. If this method\\nis called when no items remain, it will throw a NoSuchElementException.\\n• iter.hasNext() — returns a boolean value telling you whether there are more items to\\nbe processed. In general, you should test this before callin g iter.next().\\n• iter.remove() — if you call this after calling iter.next(), it will remove the item\\nthat you just saw from the collection. Note that this method h as no parameter . It\\nremoves the item that was most recently returned by iter.next(). This might produce\\nan UnsupportedOperationException, if the collection does not support removal of items.\\nUsing iterators, we can write code for printing all the items in any collection. Suppose,\\nfor example, that coll is of type Collection<String>. In that case, the value returned by\\ncoll.iterator() is of type Iterator<String>, and we can say:\\nIterator<String> iter; // Declare the iterater variable.\\niter = coll.iterator(); // Get an iterator for the collectio n.\\nwhile ( iter.hasNext() ) {\\nString item = iter.next(); // Get the next item.\\nSystem.out.println(item);\\n}'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\nThe same general form will work for other types of processing . F or example, the following code\\nwill remove all null values from any collection of type Collection<JButton> (as long as that\\ncollection supports removal of values):\\nIterator<JButton> iter = coll.iterator():\\nwhile ( iter.hasNext() ) {\\nJButton item = iter.next();\\nif (item == null)\\niter.remove();\\n}\\n(Note, by the way , that when Collection<T>, Iterator<T>, or any other parameterized type is\\nused in actual code, they are always used with actual types su ch as String or JButton in place of\\nthe “formal type parameter” T. An iterator of type Iterator<String> is used to iterate through a\\ncollection of Strings; an iterator of type Iterator<JButton> is used to iterate through a collection\\nof JButtons; and so on.)\\nAn iterator is often used to apply the same operation to all th e elements in a collection.\\nIn many cases, it’s possible to avoid the use of iterators for this purpose by using a for-each\\nloop. The for-each loop was discussed in Subsection 3.4.4 fo r use with enumerated types and\\nin Subsection 7.2.2 for use with arrays. A for-each loop can a lso be used to iterate through any\\ncollection. F or a collection coll of type Collection<T>, a for-each loop takes the form:\\nfor ( T x : coll ) { // \"for each object x, of type T, in coll\"\\n// process x\\n}\\nHere, x is the loop control variable. Each object in coll will be assigned to x in turn, and the\\nbody of the loop will be executed for each object. Since objec ts in coll are of type T, x is\\ndeclared to be of type T. F or example, if namelist is of type Collection<String>, we can print\\nout all the names in the collection with:\\nfor ( String name : namelist ) {\\nSystem.out.println( name );\\n}\\nThis for-each loop could, of course, be written as a while loop using an iterator, but the for-each\\nloop is much easier to follow.\\n10.1.6 Equality and Comparison\\nThere are several methods in the collection interface that t est objects for equality . F or exam-\\nple, the methods coll.contains(object) and coll.remove(object) look for an item in the\\ncollection that is equal to object. However, equality is not such a simple matter. The obvious\\ntechnique for testing equality—using the == operator—does not usually give a reasonable an-\\nswer when applied to objects. The == operator tests whether two objects are identical in the\\nsense that they share the same location in memory . Usually , h owever, we want to consider two\\nobjects to be equal if they represent the same value, which is a very diﬀerent thing. Two values\\nof type String should be considered equal if they contain the same sequence of characters. The\\nquestion of whether those characters are stored in the same l ocation in memory is irrelevant.\\nTwo values of type Date should be considered equal if they represent the same time.\\nThe Object class deﬁnes the boolean-valued method equals(Object) for testing whether\\none object is equal to another. This method is used by many , bu t not by all, collection\\nclasses for deciding whether two objects are to be considere d the same. In the Object class,'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING 493\\nobj1.equals(obj2) is deﬁned to be the same as obj1 == obj2. However, for most sub-classes\\nof Object, this deﬁnition is not reasonable, and it should be overridd en. The String class, for\\nexample, overrides equals() so that for a String str, str.equals(obj) if obj is also a String\\nand obj contains the same sequence of characters as str.\\nIf you write your own class, you might want to deﬁne an equals() method in that class to\\nget the correct behavior when objects are tested for equalit y . F or example, a Card class that\\nwill work correctly when used in collections could be deﬁned as:\\npublic class Card { // Class to represent playing cards.\\nint suit; // Number from 0 to 3 that codes for the suit --\\n// spades, diamonds, clubs or hearts.\\nint value; // Number from 1 to 13 that represents the value.\\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\\ntry {\\nCard other = (Card)obj; // Type-cast obj to a Card.\\nif (suit == other.suit && value == other.value) {\\n// The other card has the same suit and value as\\n// this card, so they should be considered equal.\\nreturn true;\\n}\\nelse\\nreturn false;\\n}\\ncatch (Exception e) {\\n// This will catch the NullPointerException that occurs if obj\\n// is null and the ClassCastException that occurs if obj is\\n// not of type Card. In these cases, obj is not equal to\\n// this Card, so return false.\\nreturn false;\\n}\\n}\\n.\\n. // other methods and constructors\\n.\\n}\\nWithout the equals() method in this class, methods such as contains() and remove() in the\\ninterface Collection<Card> will not work as expected.\\nA similar concern arises when items in a collection are sorte d. Sorting refers to arranging\\na sequence of items in ascending order, according to some cri terion. The problem is that there\\nis no natural notion of ascending order for arbitrary object s. Before objects can be sorted,\\nsome method must be deﬁned for comparing them. Objects that a re meant to be compared\\nshould implement the interface java.lang.Comparable. In fact, Comparable is deﬁned as a\\nparameterized interface, Comparable<T>, which represents the ability to be compared to an\\nobject of type T. The interface Comparable<T> deﬁnes one method:\\npublic int compareTo( T obj )\\nThe value returned by obj1.compareTo(obj2) should be negative if and only if obj1 comes\\nbefore obj2, when the objects are arranged in ascending order. It should be positive if and\\nonly if obj1 comes after obj2. A return value of zero means that the objects are considered'),\n",

This does n ot necessarily mean that the\\nobjects are equal in the sense that obj1.equals(obj2) is true. F or example, if the objects are\\nof type Address, representing mailing addresses, it might be useful to sort the objects by zip\\ncode. Two Addresses are considered the same for the purposes of the sort if they ha ve the same\\nzip code—but clearly that would not mean that they are the sam e address.\\nThe String class implements the interface Comparable<String> and deﬁnes compareTo in a\\nreasonable way (and in this case, the return value of compareTo is zero if and only if the two\\nstrings that are being compared are equal). If you deﬁne your own class and want to be able\\nto sort objects belonging to that class, you should do the sam e.

However, it does make sense. It means that we are g oing to compare objects that\\nbelong to the class FullName to other objects of the same type . Even though this is the only\\nreasonable thing to do, that fact is not obvious to the Java co mpiler—and the type parameter\\nin Comparable<FullName> is there for the compiler.)\\nThere is another way to allow for comparison of objects in Jav a, and that is to provide\\na separate object that is capable of making the comparison. T he object must implement the\\ninterface Comparator<T>, where T is the type of the objects that are to be compared. The\\ninterface Comparator<T> deﬁnes the method:\\npublic int compare( T obj1, T obj2 )\\nThis method compares two objects of type T and returns a value that is negative, or positive,\\nor zero, depending on whether obj1 comes before obj2, or comes after obj2, or is considered to\\nbe the same as obj2 for the purposes of this comparison. Comparators are useful for compar-\\ning objects that do not implement the Comparable interface and for deﬁning several diﬀerent\\norderings on the same collection of objects.\\nIn the next two sections, we’ll see how Comparable and Comparator are used in the context\\nof collections and maps.\\n10.1.7 Generics and Wrapper Classes\\nAs noted above, Java’s generic programming does not apply to the primitive types, since generic\\ndata structures can only hold objects, while values of primi tive type are not objects. However,\\nthe “wrapper classes” that were introduced in Subsection 5. 3.2 make it possible to get around\\nthis restriction to a great extent.\\nRecall that each primitive type has an associated wrapper cl ass: class Integer for type int,\\nclass Boolean for type boolean, class Character for type char, and so on.\\nAn object of type Integer contains a value of type int. The object serves as a “wrapper”\\nfor the primitive type value, which allows it to be used in con texts where objects are required,\\nsuch as in generic data structures. F or example, a list of Integers can be stored in a variable of\\ntype ArrayList<Integer>, and interfaces such as Collection<Integer> and Set<Integer> are deﬁned.\\nF urthermore, class Integer deﬁnes equals(), compareTo(), and toString() methods that do\\nwhat you would expect (that is, that compare and write out the corresponding primitive type\\nvalues in the usual way). Similar remarks apply for all the wr apper classes.\\nRecall also that Java does automatic conversions between a p rimitive type and the corre-\\nsponding wrapper type. (These conversions, which are calle d autoboxing and unboxing, were\\nalso introduced in Subsection 5.3.2.) This means that once y ou have created a generic data\\nstructure to hold objects belonging to one of the wrapper cla sses, you can use the data structure\\npretty much as if it actually contained primitive type value s. F or example, if numbers is a vari-\\nable of type Collection<Integer>, it is legal to call numbers.add(17) or numbers.remove(42).\\nY ou can’t literally add the primitive type value 17 to numbers, but Java will automatically con-\\nvert the 17 to the corresponding wrapper object, new Integer(17), and the wrapper object'),\n",

(The creation of the object d oes add some time and memory\\noverhead to the operation, and you should keep that in mind in situations where eﬃciency is\\nimportant. An array of int is more eﬃcient than an ArrayList<Integer>.)\\n10.2 Lists and Sets\\nIn the previous section, we looked at the general properties of collection classes i n Java. In\\nthis section, we look at some speciﬁc collection classes and how to use them. These classes can\\nbe divided into two categories: lists and sets. A list consis ts of a sequence of items arranged in\\na linear order. A list has a deﬁnite order, but is not necessar ily sorted into ascending order. A\\nset is a collection that has no duplicate entries. The elemen ts of a set might or might not be\\narranged into some deﬁnite order.\\n10.2.1 ArrayList and LinkedList\\nThere are two obvious ways to represent a list: as a dynamic ar ray and as a linked list. W e’ve\\nencountered these already in Section 7.3 and Section 9.2. Bo th of these options are available\\nin generic form as the collection classes java.util.ArrayList and java.util.LinkedList.\\nThese classes are part of the Java Collection F ramework. Eac h implements the interface List<T>,\\nand therefor the interface Collection<T>. An object of type ArrayList<T> represents an ordered\\nsequence of objects of type T, stored in an array that will grow in size whenever necessary as\\nnew items are added. An object of type LinkedList<T> also represents an ordered sequence of\\nobjects of type T, but the objects are stored in nodes that are linked together with pointers.\\nBoth list classes support the basic list operations that are deﬁned in the interface List<T>,\\nand an abstract data type is deﬁned by its operations, not by i ts representation. So why two\\nclasses? Why not a single List class with a single representa tion? The problem is that there is\\nno single representation of lists for which all list operati ons are eﬃcient. F or some operations,\\nlinked lists are more eﬃcient than arrays. F or others, array s are more eﬃcient. In a particular\\napplication of lists, it’s likely that only a few operations will be used frequently . Y ou want\\nto choose the representation for which the frequently used o perations will be as eﬃcient as\\npossible.\\nBroadly speaking, the LinkedList class is more eﬃcient in applications where items will often\\nbe added or removed at the beginning of the list or in the middl e of the list. In an array , these\\noperations require moving a large number of items up or down o ne position in the array , to\\nmake a space for a new item or to ﬁll in the hole left by the remov al of an item. In terms of\\nasymptotic analysis (Section 8.6), adding an element at the beginning or in the middle of an\\narray has run time Θ(n), where n is the number of items in the ar ray . In a linked list, nodes can\\nbe added or removed at any position by changing a few pointer v alues, an operation that has\\nrun time Θ(1). That is, the operation takes only some constan t amount of time, independent\\nof how many items are in the list.\\nOn the other hand, the ArrayList class is more eﬃcient when random access to items is\\nrequired. Random access means accessing the k-th item in the list, for any integer k. Random\\naccess is used when you get or change the value stored at a spec iﬁed position in the list. This is\\ntrivial for an array , with run time Θ(1). But for a linked list it means starting at the beginning\\nof the list and moving from node to node along the list for k ste ps, an operation that has run\\ntime Θ(n).'),\n",

LISTS AND SETS 497\\nOperations that can be done eﬃciently for both types of lists include sorting and adding an\\nitem at the end of the list.\\nAll lists implement the methods from interface Collection<T> that were discussed in Sub-\\nsection 10.1.4. These methods include size(), isEmpty(), add(T), remove(Object), and\\nclear(). The add(T) method adds the object at the end of the list. The remove(Object)\\nmethod involves ﬁrst ﬁnding the object, which is not very eﬃc ient for any list since it involves\\ngoing through the items in the list from beginning to end unti l the object is found. The interface\\nList<T> adds some methods for accessing list items according to thei r numerical positions in\\nthe list. Suppose that list is an object of type List<T>. Then we have the methods:\\n• list.get(index) — returns the object of type T that is at position index in the list,\\nwhere index is an integer. Items are numbered 0, 1, 2, . . . , list.size()-1. The param-\\neter must be in this range, or an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.\\n• list.set(index,obj) — stores the object obj at position number index in the list,\\nreplacing the object that was there previously . The object obj must be of type T. This\\ndoes not change the number of elements in the list or move any o f the other elements.\\n• list.add(index,obj) — inserts an object obj into the list at position number index,\\nwhere obj must be of type T. The number of items in the list increases by one, and items\\nthat come after position index move up one position to make room for the new item. The\\nvalue of index must be in the range 0 to list.size(), inclusive. If index is equal to\\nlist.size(), then obj is added at the end of the list.\\n• list.remove(index) — removes the object at position number index, and returns that\\nobject as the return value of the method. Items after this pos ition move up one space in\\nthe list to ﬁll the hole, and the size of the list decreases by o ne. The value of index must\\nbe in the range 0 to list.size()-1\\n• list.indexOf(obj) — returns an int that gives the position of obj in the list, if it occurs.\\nIf it does not occur, the return value is -1. The object obj can be of any type, not just\\nof type T. If obj occurs more than once in the list, the index of the ﬁrst occurr ence is\\nreturned.\\nThese methods are deﬁned both in class ArrayList<T> and in class LinkedList<T>, although\\nsome of them— get and set—are only eﬃcient for ArrayLists. The class LinkedList<T> adds a\\nfew additional methods, which are not deﬁned for an ArrayList. If linkedlist is an object of\\ntype LinkedList<T>, then we have\\n• linkedlist.getFirst() — returns the object of type T that is the ﬁrst item in the list.\\nThe list is not modiﬁed. If the list is empty when the method is called, an exception of\\ntype NoSuchElementException is thrown (the same is true for the next three methods as\\nwell).\\n• linkedlist.getLast() — returns the object of type T that is the last item in the list.\\nThe list is not modiﬁed.\\n• linkedlist.removeFirst() — removes the ﬁrst item from the list, and returns that\\nobject of type T as its return value.\\n• linkedlist.removeLast() — removes the last item from the list, and returns that object\\nof type T as its return value.\\n• linkedlist.addFirst(obj) — adds the obj, which must be of type T, to the beginning\\nof the list.'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\n• linkedlist.addLast(obj) — adds the object obj, which must be of type T, to the end\\nof the list. (This is exactly the same as linkedlist.add(obj) and is apparently deﬁned\\njust to keep the naming consistent.)\\nThese methods are apparently deﬁned to make it easy to use a LinkedList as if it were a\\nstack or a queue. (See Section 9.3.) F or example, we can use a LinkedList as a queue by adding\\nitems onto one end of the list (using the addLast() method) and removing them from the other\\nend (using the removeFirst() method).\\nIf list is an object of type List<T>, then the method list.iterator(), deﬁned in the\\ninterface Collection<T>, returns an Iterator that can be used to traverse the list from beginning\\nto end. However, for Lists, there is a special type of Iterator, called a ListIterator, which oﬀers\\nadditional capabilities. ListIterator<T> is an interface that extends the interface Iterator<T>.\\nThe method list.listIterator() returns an object of type ListIterator<T>.\\nA ListIterator has the usual Iterator methods, hasNext(), next(), and remove(), but it\\nalso has methods hasPrevious(), previous(), and add(obj) that make it possible to move\\nbackwards in the list and to add an item at the current positio n of the iterator. T o understand\\nhow these work, it’s best to think of an iterator as pointing t o a position between two list\\nelements, or at the beginning or end of the list. In this diagr am, the items in a list are\\nrepresented by squares, and arrows indicate the possible po sitions of an iterator:\\nIf iter is of type ListIterator<T>, then iter.next() moves the iterator one space to the\\nright along the list and returns the item that the iterator pa sses as it moves. The method\\niter.previous() moves the iterator one space to the left along the list and ret urns the item\\nthat it passes. The method iter.remove() removes an item from the list; the item that is\\nremoved is the item that the iterator passed most recently in a call to either iter.next() or\\niter.previous(). There is also a method iter.add(obj) that adds the speciﬁed object to the\\nlist at the current position of the iterator (where obj must be of type T ). This can be between\\ntwo existing items or at the beginning of the list or at the end of the list.\\n(By the way , the lists that are used in class LinkedList<T> are doubly linked lists .\\nThat is, each node in the list contains two pointers—one to th e next node in the list and\\none to the previous node. This makes it possible to eﬃciently implement both the next()\\nand previous() methods of a ListIterator. Also, to make the addLast() and getLast()\\nmethods of a LinkedList eﬃcient, the class LinkedList<T> includes an instance variable that\\npoints to the last node in the list.)\\nAs an example of using a ListIterator, suppose that we want to maintain a list of items that\\nis always sorted into increasing order. When adding an item t o the list, we can use a ListIterator\\nto ﬁnd the position in the list where the item should be added. Once the position has been\\nfound, we use the same list iterator to place the item in that p osition. The idea is to start at\\nthe beginning of the list and to move the iterator forward pas t all the items that are smaller\\nthan the item that is being inserted. At that point, the itera tor’s add() method can be used to\\ninsert the item. T o be more deﬁnite, suppose that stringList is a variable of type List<String>.\\nAssume that that the strings that are already in the list are s tored in ascending order and that\\nnewItem is a string that we would like to insert into the list. The foll owing code will place\\nnewItem in the list in its correct position, so that the modiﬁed list i s still in ascending order:'),\n",

It migh t be useful for you to think about\\nwhy this is true.)\\n10.2.2 Sorting\\nSorting a list is a fairly common operation, and there should really be a sorting method in the\\nList interface. There is not, presumably because it only makes se nse to sort lists of certain\\ntypes of objects, but methods for sorting lists are availabl e as static methods in the class\\njava.util.Collections. This class contains a variety of static utility methods for working\\nwith collections. The methods are generic; that is, they wil l work for collections of objects of\\nvarious types. Suppose that list is of type List<T>. The command\\nCollections.sort(list);\\ncan be used to sort the list into ascending order. The items in the list should implement the\\ninterface Comparable<T> (see Subsection 10.1.6). The method Collections.sort() will work,\\nfor example, for lists of String and for lists of any of the wrapper classes such as Integer and\\nDouble. There is also a sorting method that takes a Comparator as its second argument:\\nCollections.sort(list,comparator);\\nIn this method, the comparator will be used to compare the items in the list. As mentioned\\nin the previous section, a Comparator is an object that deﬁnes a compare() method that can\\nbe used to compare two objects. W e’ll see an example of using a Comparator in Section 10.4.\\nThe sorting method that is used by Collections.sort() is the so-called “merge sort”\\nalgorithm, which has both worst-case and average-case run t imes that are Θ(n*log(n)) for'),\n",

MergeSort also has a nice property cal led “stability” that we will encounter\\nat the end of Subsection 10.4.3.\\nThe Collections class has at least two other useful methods for modifying lis ts.\\nCollections.shuffle(list) will rearrange the elements of the list into a random order.\\nCollections.reverse(list) will reverse the order of the elements, so that the last eleme nt is\\nmoved to the beginning of the list, the next-to-last element to the second position, and so on.\\nSince an eﬃcient sorting method is provided for Lists, there is no need to write one your-\\nself. Y ou might be wondering whether there is an equally conv enient method for standard\\narrays. The answer is yes. Array-sorting methods are availa ble as static methods in the class\\njava.util.Arrays. The statement\\nArrays.sort(A);\\nwill sort an array , A, provided either that the base type of A is one of the primitive types (except\\nboolean) or that A is an array of Objects that implement the Comparable interface. Y ou can\\nalso sort part of an array . This is important since arrays are often only “partially ﬁlled.” The\\ncommand:\\nArrays.sort(A,fromIndex,toIndex);\\nsorts the elements A[fromIndex], A[fromIndex+1], . . . , A[toIndex-1] into ascending order.\\nY ou can use Arrays.sort(A,0,N-1) to sort a partially ﬁlled array which has items in the ﬁrst\\nN positions.\\nJava does not support generic programming for primitive typ es. In order to implement the\\ncommand Arrays.sort(A), the Arrays class contains eight methods: one method for arrays\\nof Objects and one method for each of the primitive types byte, short, int, long, ﬂoat , double,\\nand char.\\n10.2.3 T reeSet and HashSet\\nA set is a collection of objects in which no object occurs more than once. Sets implement all\\nthe methods in the interface Collection<T>, but do so in a way that ensures that no element\\noccurs twice in the set. F or example, if set is an object of type Set<T>, then set.add(obj)\\nwill have no eﬀect on the set if obj is already an element of the set. Java has two classes that\\nimplement the interface Set<T>: java.util.TreeSet and java.util.HashSet.\\nIn addition to being a Set, a T reeSet has the property that the elements of the set are\\narranged into ascending sorted order. An Iterator for a TreeSet will always visit the elements\\nof the set in ascending order.\\nA T reeSet cannot hold arbitrary objects, since there must be a way to de termine the sorted\\norder of the objects it contains. Ordinarily , this means tha t the objects in a set of type\\nT reeSet<T> should implement the interface Comparable<T> and that obj1.compareTo(obj2)\\nshould be deﬁned in a reasonable way for any two objects obj1 and obj2 in the set. Alter-\\nnatively , an object of type Comparator<T> can be provided as a parameter to the constructor\\nwhen the T reeSet is created. In that case, the compareTo() method of the Comparator will be\\nused to compare objects that are added to the set.\\nA T reeSet does not use the equals() method to test whether two objects are the same.\\nInstead, it uses the compareTo() method. This can be a problem. Recall from Subsection 10.1.6\\nthat compareTo() can consider two objects to be the same for the purpose of the c omparison'),\n",

LISTS AND SETS 501\\neven though the objects are not equal. F or a T reeSet, this means that only one of those objects\\ncan be in the set. F or example, if the T reeSet contains mailing addresses and if the compareTo()\\nmethod for addresses just compares their zip codes, then the set can contain only one address in\\neach zip code. Clearly , this is not right! But that only means that you have to be aware of the\\nsemantics of T reeSets, and you need to make sure that compareTo() is deﬁned in a reasonable\\nway for objects that you put into a T reeSet. This will be true, by the way , for Strings, Integers,\\nand many other built-in types, since the compareTo() method for these types considers two\\nobjects to be the same only if they are actually equal.\\nIn the implementation of a T reeSet, the elements are stored in something similar to a binary\\nsort tree. (See Subsection 9.4.2.) However, the data struct ure that is used is balanced in the\\nsense that all the leaves of the tree are at about the same dist ance from the root of the tree.\\nThis ensures that all the basic operations—inserting, dele ting, and searching—are eﬃcient, with\\nworst-case run time Θ(log(n)), where n is the number of items in the set.\\nThe fact that a T reeSet sorts its elements and removes duplicates makes it very usef ul in\\nsome applications. Exercise 7.6 asked you to write a program that would read a ﬁle and output\\nan alphabetical list of all the words that occurred in the ﬁle , with duplicates removed. The\\nwords were to be stored in an ArrayList, so it was up to you to make sure that the list was\\nsorted and contained no duplicates. The same task can be prog rammed much more easily\\nusing a T reeSet instead of a list. A T reeSet automatically eliminates duplicates, and an iterator\\nfor the set will automatically visit the items in the set in so rted order. An algorithm for the\\nprogram, using a T reeSet, would be:\\nTreeSet<String> words = new TreeSet<String>();\\nwhile there is more data in the input file:\\nLet word = the next word from the file\\nConvert word to lower case\\nwords.add(word) // Adds the word only if not already present .\\nIterator<String> iter = words.iterator();\\nwhile (iter.hasNext()):\\nOutput iter.next() // Prints the words in sorted order.\\nIf you would like to see a complete, working program, you can ﬁ nd it in the ﬁle WordListWith-\\nTreeSet.java.\\nAs another example, suppose that coll is any Collection of Strings. (This would also\\nwork for any other type for which compareTo() is properly deﬁned). W e can use a T reeSet to\\nsort the items of coll and remove the duplicates simply by saying:\\nTreeSet<String> set = new TreeSet();\\nset.addAll(coll);\\nThe second statement adds all the elements of the collection to the set. Since it’s a Set,\\nduplicates are ignored. Since it’s a T reeSet, the elements of the set are sorted. If you would like\\nto have the data in some other type of data structure, it’s eas y to copy the data from the set.\\nF or example, to place the answer in an ArrayList, you could say:\\nTreeSet<String> set = new TreeSet<String>();\\nset.addAll(coll);\\nArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();\\nlist.addAll(set);'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\nNow, in fact, every one of Java’s collection classes has a con structor that takes a Collection\\nas an argument. All the items in that Collection are added to the new collection when it is\\ncreated. So, if coll is of type Collection<String>, then “ new TreeSet<String>(coll) creates\\na T reeSet that contains the same elements as coll, but with duplicates removed and in sorted\\norder. This means that we can abbreviate the four lines in the above example to the single\\ncommand:\\nArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>( new TreeSet<String>(coll) );\\nThis makes a sorted list of the elements of coll with no duplicates. Although the repeated\\ntype parameter, “ <String>”, makes it a bit ugly to look at, this is still a nice example of the\\npower of generic programming. (It seems, by the way , there is no equally easy way to get a\\nsorted list with duplicates. T o do this, we would need something like a T reeSet that allows\\nduplicates. The C++ programming language has such a thing an d refers to it as a multiset.\\nThe Smalltalk language has something similar and calls it a bag. Java, for the time being at\\nleast, lacks this data type.)\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nA HashSet stores its elements in a hash table , a type of data structure that I will discuss\\nin the next section. The operations of ﬁnding, adding, and re moving elements are implemented\\nvery eﬃciently in hash tables, even more so than for T reeSets. The elements of a HashSet are not\\nstored in any particular order, and so do not need to implemen t the Comparable interface. The\\nequals() method is used to determine whether two objects in a HashSet are to be considered\\nthe same. An Iterator for a HashSet will visit its elements in what seems to be a completely\\narbitrary order, and it’s possible for the order to change co mpletely when a new element is\\nadded. Use a HashSet instead of a T reeSet when the elements it contains are not comparable,\\nor when the order is not important, or when the small advantag e in eﬃciency is important\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nA note about the mathematics of sets: In mathematical set the ory , the items in a set are\\ncalled members or elements of that set. Important operations include adding an element\\nto a set, removing an element from a set, and testing whether a given entity is an element of\\na set. Operations that can be performed on two sets include union, intersection, and set\\ndiﬀerence . All these operations are deﬁned in Java for objects of type Set, but with diﬀerent\\nnames. Suppose that A and B are Sets. Then:\\n• A.add(x) adds the element x to the set A.\\n• A.remove(x) removes the element x from the set A.\\n• A.contains(x) tests whether x is an element of the set A.\\n• A.addAll(B) computes the union of A and B.\\n• A.retainAll(B) computes the intersection of A and B.\\n• A.removeAll(B) computes the set diﬀerence , A - B.\\nThere are of course, diﬀerences between mathematical sets a nd sets in Java. Most important,\\nperhaps, sets in Java must be ﬁnite, while in mathematics, mo st of the fun in set theory comes\\nfrom working with inﬁnity . In mathematics, a set can contain arbitrary elements, while in Java,\\na set of type Set<T> can only contain elements of type T. The operation A.addAll(B) acts by\\nmodifying the value of A, while in mathematics the operation A union B computes a new set,\\nwithout changing the value of A or B. See Exercise 10.2 for an example of mathematical set\\noperations in Java.'),\n",

LISTS AND SETS 503\\n10.2.4 EnumSet\\nEnumerated types (or “enums”) were introduced in Subsectio n 2.3.3. Suppose that E is an\\nenumerated type. Since E is a class, it is possible to create objects of type T reeSet<E> and Hash-\\nSet<E>. However, because enums are so simple, trees and hash tables are not the most eﬃcient\\nimplementation for sets of enumerated type values. Java pro vides the class java.util.EnumSet\\nas an alternative way to create such sets.\\nSets of enumerated type values are created using static methods in the class EnumSet. F or\\nexample, if e1, e2, and e3 are values belonging to the enumerated type E, then the method\\nEnumSet.of( e1, e2, e3 )\\ncreates and returns a set of type EnumSet<E> that contains exactly the elements e1, e2, and\\ne3. The set implements the interface Set<E>, so all the usual set and collection operations are\\navailable. The implementation of these operations is very e ﬃcient. The implementation uses\\nwhat is called a bit vector . A bit is a quantity that has only two possible values, zero an d one.\\nA set of type EnumSet<E> is represented by a bit vector that contains one bit for each e num\\nconstant in the enumerated type E ; the bit corresponding to the enum constant e is 1 if e is\\na member of the set and is 0 if e is not a member of the set. The bit vectors for two sets of\\ntype EnumSet<E> can be very easily combined to represent such operations as t he union and\\nintersection of two sets. The bit vector representation is f easible for EnumSets, but not for\\nother sets in Java, because an enumerated type contains only a small ﬁnite number of enum\\nconstants. (Java actually has a class named BitSet that uses bit vectors to represent ﬁnite sets\\nof non-negative integers, but this class is not part of the Ja va Collection F ramework and does\\nnot implement the Set interface.)\\nThe function EnumSet.of can be used with any positive number of parameters. All the\\nparameters must be values of the same enumerated type. Null v alues are not allowed. An\\nEnumSet cannot contain the value null—any attempt to add null to an EnumSet will result\\nin a NullPointerException.\\nThere is also a function EnumSet.range(e1,e2) that returns an EnumSet consisting of the\\nenum constants between e1 and e2, inclusive. The ordering of enum constants is the same as\\nthe order in which they are listed in the deﬁnition of the enum . In EnumSet.range(e1,e2), e1\\nand e2 must belong to the same enumerated type, and e1 must be less than or equal to e2.\\nIf E is an enum, then EnumSet.allOf(E.class) is a set that contains all values of type\\nE. EnumSet.noneOf(E.class) is an empty set , a set of type EnumSet<E> that contains no\\nelements at all. Note that in EnumSet.allOf(E.class) and EnumSet.noneOf(E.class), the\\nodd-looking paramter represents the enumerated type class itself. If eset is a set of type\\nEnumSet<E>, then EnumSet.complementOf(eset) is a set that contains all the enum constants\\nof E that are not in eset.\\nAs an example, consider a program that keeps schedules of eve nts. The program must\\nkeep track of repeating events that happen on speciﬁed days o f the week. F or example, an\\nevent might take place only on weekdays, or only on W ednesday s and F ridays. In other words,\\nassociated with the event is the set of days of the week on which it takes place. This information\\ncan be represented using the enumerated type\\nenum Day { SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY }\\nThe days of the week on which an event takes place would then be a value of type EnumSet<Day>.\\nAn object of type RepeatingEvent would have an instance variable of type EnumSet<Day> to\\nhold this information. An event that takes place on W ednesda ys and F ridays would have the\\nassociated set'),\n",

F or example, a program that draws characters in fancy fonts might have various\\noptions that can be applied. Let’s say that the options are bo ld, italic, underlined, strikethrough,\\nand boxed. Note that we are assuming that options can be combi ned in arbitrary ways. F or\\nexample, you can have italic, boxed, underlined characters . This just means that we need to\\nkeep track of a set of options. If the options are represented by the enumerated type\\nenum FontOption { BOLD, ITALIC, UNDERLINED, STRIKETHROUGH, BOXED }\\nthen a set of options is represented by a value of type EnumSet<FontOption>. Suppose that\\noptions is a variable of this type that represents the set of options t hat are currently being\\napplied by the program. Then we can do things like:\\n• options = EnumSet.noneOf( FontOption.class ) — T urn oﬀ all options.\\n• options = EnumSet.of( FontOption.BOLD ) — Use bold, with no other options.\\n• options.add( FontOption.BOLD ) — Add bold to any options that are already on.\\n• options.remove( FontOption.UNDERLINED ) — T urn underlining oﬀ (if it’s on).\\nThis is a nice, safe way to work with sets of options, and appli cations like this are one of the\\nmajor reasons that enumerated types were introduced.\\n10.3 Maps\\nAn array of N elements can be thought of as a way of associating some item with each of\\nthe integers 0, 1, . . . , N-1. If i is one of these integers, it’s possible to get the item associated\\nwith i, and it’s possible to put a new item in the i-th position. These “get” and “put”\\noperations deﬁne what it means to be an array .\\nA map is a kind of generalized array . Like an array , a map is deﬁned b y “get” and “put”\\noperations. But in a map, these operations are deﬁned not for integers 0, 1, . . . , N-1, but for\\narbitrary objects of some speciﬁed type T. Associated to these objects of type T are objects of\\nsome possibly diﬀerent type S.\\nIn fact, some programming languages use the term associative array instead of “map”\\nand use the same notation for associative arrays as for regul ar arrays. In those languages,\\nfor example, you might see the notation A[\"fred\"] used to indicate the item associated to the\\nstring “fred” in the associative array A. Java does not use array notation for maps, unfortunately ,\\nbut the idea is the same: A map is like an array , but the indices for a map are objects, not\\nintegers. In a map, an object that serves as an “index” is call ed a key. The object that is\\nassociated with a key is called a value. Note that a key can have at most one associated value,\\nbut the same value can be associated to several diﬀerent keys . A map can be considered to be\\na set of “associations,” where each association is a key/val ue pair.'),\n",

MAPS 505\\n10.3.1 The Map Interface\\nIn Java, maps are deﬁned by the interface java.util.Map, which includes put and get methods\\nas well as other general methods for working with maps. The ma p interface, Map<T,S>, is\\nparameterized by two types. The ﬁrst type parameter, T, speciﬁes the type of objects that are\\npossible keys in the map; the second type parameter, S, speciﬁes the type of objects that are\\npossible values in the map. F or example, a map of type Map<Date,JButton> would associate\\nvalues of type JButton to keys of type Date. F or a map of type Map<String,String>, both the\\nkeys and the values are of type String.\\nSuppose that map is a variable of type Map<T,S> for some speciﬁc types T and S. Then the\\nfollowing are some of the methods that are deﬁned for map:\\n• map.get(key) — returns the object of type S that is associated by the map to the key.\\nkey can be any object; it does not have to be of type T. If the map does not associate\\nany value with obj, then the return value is null. Note that it’s also possible for the\\nreturn value to be null when the map explicitly associates the value null with the key .\\nReferring to “ map.get(key)” is similar to referring to “ A[key]” for an array A. (But note\\nthat there is nothing like an IndexOutOfBoundsException for maps.)\\n• map.put(key,value) — Associates the speciﬁed value with the speciﬁed key, where key\\nmust be of type T and value must be of type S. If the map already associated some\\nother value with the key , then the new value replaces the old o ne. This is similar to the\\ncommand “ A[key] = value” for an array .\\n• map.putAll(map2) — if map2 is another map of type Map<T,S>, this copies all the asso-\\nciations from map2 into map.\\n• map.remove(key) — if map associates a value to the speciﬁed key, that association is\\nremoved from the map. key can be any object; it does not have to be of type T.\\n• map.containsKey(key) — returns a boolean value that is true if the map associates some\\nvalue to the speciﬁed key. key can be any object; it does not have to be of type T.\\n• map.containsValue(value) — returns a boolean value that is true if the map associates\\nthe speciﬁed value to some key . value can be any object; it does not have to be of type S.\\n• map.size() — returns an int that gives the number of associations in the map.\\n• map.isEmpty() — returns a boolean value that is true if the map is empty , that is if it\\ncontains no associations.\\n• map.clear() — removes all associations from the map, leaving it empty .\\nThe put and get methods are certainly the most commonly used of the methods i n the Map\\ninterface. In many applications, these are the only methods that are needed, and in such cases\\na map is really no more diﬃcult to use than a standard array .\\nJava includes two classes that implement the interface Map<T,S>: T reeMap<T,S> and\\nHashMap<T,S>. In a T reeMap, the key/value associations are stored in a sorted tree, in w hich\\nthey are sorted according to their keys. F or this to work, it must be possible to compare the\\nkeys to one another. This means either that the keys must impl ement the interface Compara-\\nble<T>, or that a Comparator must be provided for comparing keys. (The Comparator can be\\nprovided as a parameter to the T reeMap constructor.) Note that in a T reeMap, as in a T reeSet,\\nthe compareTo() method is used to decide whether two keys are to be considered the same.\\nThis can have undesirable consequences if the compareTo() method does not agree with the\\nusual notion of equality , and you should keep this in mind whe n using T reeMaps.'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\nA HashMap does not store associations in any particular order, so the k eys that can be used\\nin a HashMap do not have to be comparable. However, the key class should ha ve reasonable\\ndeﬁnitions for the equals() method and for a hashCode() method that is discussed later in\\nthis section; most of Java’s standard classes deﬁne these me thods correctly . Most operations are\\na little faster on HashMaps than they are on T reeMaps. In general, you should use a HashMap\\nunless you have some particular need for the ordering proper ty of a T reeMap. In particular, if\\nyou are only using the put and get operations, you can safely use a HashMap.\\nLet’s consider an example where maps would be useful. In Subs ection 7.4.2, I presented\\na simple PhoneDirectory class that associated phone numbers with names. That class d eﬁned\\noperations addEntry(name,number) and getNumber(name), where both name and number are\\ngiven as Strings. In fact, the phone directory is acting just like a map, with t he addEntry\\nmethod playing the role of the put operation and getNumber playing the role of get. In a real\\nprogramming application, there would be no need to deﬁne a ne w class; we could simply use a\\nmap of type Map<String,String>. A directory would be deﬁned as\\nMap<String,String> directory = new Map<String,String>();\\nand then directory.put(name,number) would record a phone number in the directory and\\ndirectory.get(name) would retrieve the phone number associated with a given name .\\n10.3.2 Views, SubSets, and SubMaps\\nA Map is not a Collection, and maps do not implement all the operations deﬁned on colle ctions.\\nIn particular, there are no iterators for maps. Sometimes, t hough, it’s useful to be able to\\niterate through all the associations in a map. Java makes thi s possible is a roundabout but\\nclever way . If map is a variable of type Map<T,S>, then the method\\nmap.keySet()\\nreturns the set of all objects that occur as keys for associat ions in the map. The value returned\\nby this method is an object that implements the interface Set<T>. The elements of this set\\nare the map’s keys. The obvious way to implement the keySet() method would be to create\\na new set object, add all the keys from the map, and return that set. But that’s not how it’s\\ndone. The value returned by map.keySet() is not an independent object. It is what is called a\\nview of the actual objects that are stored in the map. This “view” o f the map implements the\\nSet<T> interface, but it does it in such a way that the methods deﬁned in the interface refer\\ndirectly to keys in the map. F or example, if you remove a key fr om the view, that key—along\\nwith its associated value—is actually removed from the map. It’s not legal to add an object\\nto the view, since it doesn’t make sense to add a key to a map wit hout specifying the value\\nthat should be associated to the key . Since map.keySet() does not create a new set, it’s very\\neﬃcient, even for very large maps.\\nOne of the things that you can do with a Set is get an Iterator for it and use the iterator to\\nvisit each of the elements of the set in turn. W e can use an iter ator for the key set of a map to\\ntraverse the map. F or example, if map is of type Set<String,Double>, we could write:\\nSet<String> keys = map.keySet(); // The set of keys in the map .\\nIterator<String> keyIter = keys.iterator();\\nSystem.out.println(\"The map contains the following associations:\");\\nwhile (keyIter.hasNext()) {\\nString key = keyIter.next(); // Get the next key.\\nDouble value = map.get(key); // Get the value for that key.\\nSystem.out.println( \" (\" + key + \",\" + value + \")\" );'),\n",

F or a HashMap, the keys are visited in an arbitrary , unpredictable\\norder.\\nThe Map interface deﬁnes two other views. If map is a variable of type Map<T,S>, then the\\nmethod:\\nmap.values()\\nreturns an object of type Collection<S> that contains all the values from the associations that\\nare stored in the map. The return value is a Collection rather than a Set because it can contain\\nduplicate elements (since a map can associate the same value to any number of keys). The\\nmethod:\\nmap.entrySet()\\nreturns a set that contains all the associations from the map . The elements in the set are\\nobjects of type Map.Entry<T,S>. Map.Entry<T,S> is deﬁned as a static nested interface inside\\nthe interface Map<T,S>, so its full name contains a period. However, it can be used in the same\\nway as any other type name. (The return type of the method map.entrySet() is written as\\nSet<Map.Entry<T,S>>. The type parameter in this case is itself a parameterized ty pe. Although\\nthis might look confusing, it’s just Java’s way of saying tha t the elements of the set are of\\ntype Map.Entry<T,S>.) The information in the set returned by map.entrySet() is actually no\\ndiﬀerent from the information in the map itself, but the set p rovides a diﬀerent view of this\\ninformation, with diﬀerent operations. Each Map.Entry object contains one key/value pair,\\nand deﬁnes methods getKey() and getValue() for retrieving the key and the value. There is\\nalso a method, setValue(value), for setting the value; calling this method for a Map.Entry\\nobject will modify the map itself, just as if the map’s put method were called. As an example,\\nwe can use the entry set of a map to print all the key/value pair s in the map. This is more\\neﬃcient than using the key set to print the same information, as I did in the above example,\\nsince we don’t have to use the get() method to look up the value associated with each key .\\nSuppose again that map is of type Map<String,Double>. Then we can write:\\nSet<Map.Entry<String,Double>> entries = map.entrySet();\\nIterator<Map.Entry<String,Double>> entryIter = entries.iterator();\\nSystem.out.println(\"The map contains the following associations:\");\\nwhile (entryIter.hasNext()) {\\nMap.Entry<String,Double> entry = entryIter.next();\\nString key = entry.getKey(); // Get the key from the entry.\\nDouble value = entry.getValue(); // Get the value.\\nSystem.out.println( \" (\" + key + \",\" + value + \")\" );\\n}\\nor, using a for-each loop:'),\n",

F or example, the interface List<T> deﬁnes a sublist as a view of a part of a list. If list\\nimplements the interface List<T>, then the method:\\nlist.subList( fromIndex, toIndex )\\nwhere fromIndex and toList are integers, returns a view of the part of the list consistin g of the\\nlist elements in positions between fromIndex and toIndex (including fromIndex but excluding\\ntoIndex). This view lets you operate on the sublist using any of the op erations deﬁned for\\nlists, but the sublist is not an independent list. Changes ma de to the sublist are actually made\\nto the original list.\\nSimilarly , it is possible to obtain views that represent cer tain subsets of a sorted set. If\\nset is of type T reeSet<T>, then set.subSet(fromElement,toElement) returns a Set<T> that\\ncontains all the elements of set that are between fromElement and toElement (including\\nfromElement and excluding toElement). The parameters fromElement and toElement must\\nbe objects of type T. F or example, if words is a set of type T reeSet<String> in which all the\\nelements are strings of lower case letters, then words.subSet(\"m\",\"n\") contains all the ele-\\nments of words that begin with the letter ’m’. This subset is a view of part of the original\\nset. That is, creating the subset does not involve copying el ements. And changes made to\\nthe subset, such as adding or removing elements, are actuall y made to the original set. The\\nview set.headSet(toElement) consists of all elements from the set which are strictly less than\\ntoElement, and set.tailSet(fromElement) is a view that contains all elements from the set\\nthat are greater than or equal to fromElement.\\nThe class T reeMap<T,S> deﬁnes three submap views. A submap is similar to a subset.\\nA submap is a Map that contains a subset of the keys from the original Map, along with\\ntheir associated values. If map is a variable of type T reeMap<T,S>, and if fromKey and toKey\\nare of type T, then map.subMap(fromKey,toKey) returns a view that contains all key/value\\npairs from map whose keys are between fromKey and toKey (including fromKey and excluding\\ntoKey). There are also views map.headMap(toKey) and map.tailMap(fromKey) which are\\ndeﬁned analogously to headSet and tailSet. Suppose, for example, that blackBook is a map\\nof type T reeMap<String,String> in which the keys are names and the values are phone numbers.\\nW e can print out all the entries from blackBook where the name begins with “M” as follows:\\nMap<String,String> ems = blackBook.subMap(\"M\",\"N\");\\n// This submap contains entries for which the key is greater\\n// than or equal to \"M\" and strictly less than \"N\".\\nif (ems.isEmpty()) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"No entries beginning with M.\");\\n}\\nelse {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Entries beginning with M:\");\\nfor ( Map.Entry<String,String> entry : ems.entrySet() )\\nSystem.out.println( \" \" + entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getV alue() );\\n}'),\n",

MAPS 509\\nSubsets and submaps are probably best thought of as generali zed search operations that\\nmake it possible to ﬁnd all the items in a range of values, rath er than just to ﬁnd a single\\nvalue. Suppose, for example that a database of scheduled eve nts is stored in a map of type\\nT reeMap<Date,Event> in which the keys are the times of the events, and suppose you w ant a\\nlisting of all events that are scheduled for some time on July 4, 2007. Just make a submap\\ncontaining all keys in the range from 12:00 AM, July 4, 2007 to 12:00 AM, July 5, 2007, and\\noutput all the entries from that submap. This type of search, which is known as a subrange\\nquery is quite common.\\n10.3.3 Hash T ables and Hash Codes\\nHashSets and HashMaps are implemented using a data structure known as a hash table .\\nY ou don’t need to understand hash tables to use HashSets or HashMaps, but any computer\\nprogrammer should be familiar with hash tables and how they w ork.\\nHash tables are an elegant solution to the search problem. A h ash table, like a HashMap,\\nstores key/value pairs. Given a key , you have to search the ta ble for the corresponding key/value\\npair. When a hash table is used to implement a set, the values a re all null, and the only question\\nis whether or not the key occurs in the set. Y ou still have to se arch for the key to check whether\\nit is there or not.\\nIn most search algorithms, in order to ﬁnd the item you are int erested in, you have to look\\nthrough a bunch of other items that don’t interest you. T o ﬁnd something in an unsorted list,\\nyou have to go though the items one-by-one until you come to th e one you are looking for. In\\na binary sort tree, you have to start at the root and move down t he tree until you ﬁnd the\\nitem you want. When you search for a key/value pair in a hash ta ble, you can go directly to\\nthe location that contains the item you want. Y ou don’t have t o look through any other items.\\n(This is not quite true, but it’s close.) The location of the k ey/value pair is computed from the\\nkey: Y ou just look at the key , and then you go directly to the lo cation where it is stored.\\nHow can this work? If the keys were integers in the range 0 to 99 , we could store the\\nkey/value pairs in an array , A, of 100 elements. The key/value pair with key K would be stored\\nin A[K]. The key takes us directly to the location of the key/value pa ir. The problem is that\\nthere are usually far too many diﬀerent possible keys for us t o be able to use an array with\\none location for each possible key . F or example, if the key ca n be any value of type int, then\\nwe would need an array with over four billion locations—quit e a waste of space if we are only\\ngoing to store, say , a few thousand items! If the key can be a st ring of any length, then the\\nnumber of possible keys is inﬁnite, and using an array with on e location for each possible key\\nis simply impossible.\\nNevertheless, hash tables store their data in an array , and t he array index where a key is\\nstored is based on the key . The index is not equal to the key , bu t it is computed from the key .\\nThe array index for a key is called the hash code for that key . A function that computes a\\nhash code, given a key , is called a hash function . T o ﬁnd a key in a hash table, you just have\\nto compute the hash code of the key and go directly to the array location given by that hash\\ncode. If the hash code is 17, look in array location number 17.\\nNow, since there are fewer array locations than there are pos sible keys, it’s possible that\\nwe might try to store two or more keys in the same array locatio n. This is called a collision.\\nA collision is not an error. W e can’t reject a key just because another key happened to have\\nthe same hash code. A hash table must be able to handle collisi ons in some reasonable way . In\\nthe type of hash table that is used in Java, each array locatio n actually holds a linked list of'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\nkey/value pairs (possibly an empty list). When two items hav e the same hash code, they are\\nin the same linked list. The structure of the hash table looks something like this:\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n1 0\\n1 1\\ni t e m\\ni t e m i t e m\\ni t e m\\ni t e m i t e m i t e m\\ni t e m i t e m\\ni t e m\\nIn this diagram, there is one item with hash code 0, no items wi th hash code 1, two items with\\nhash code 2, and so on. In a properly designed hash table, most of the linked lists are of length\\nzero or one, and the average length of the lists is less than on e. Although the hash code of a key\\ndoesn’t necessarily take you directly to that key , there are probably no more than one or two\\nother items that you have to look through before ﬁnding the ke y you want. F or this to work\\nproperly , the number of items in the hash table should be some what less than the number of\\nlocations in the array . In Java’s implementation, whenever the number of items exceeds 75%\\nof the array size, the array is replaced by a larger one and all the items in the old array are\\ninserted into the new one. (This is why adding one new item wil l sometimes cause the ordering\\nof all the items in the hash table to change completely .)\\nThere is still the question of where hash codes come from. Eve ry object in Java has a\\nhash code. The Object class deﬁnes the method hashCode(), which returns a value of type\\nint. When an object, obj, is stored in a hash table that has N locations, a hash code in the\\nrange 0 to N-1 is needed. This hash code is computed as Math.abs(obj.hashCode()) % N,\\nthe remainder when the absolute value of obj.hashCode() is divided by N. (The Math.abs\\nis necessary because obj.hashCode() can be a negative integer, and we need a non-negative\\nnumber to use as an array index.)\\nF or hashing to work properly , two objects that are equal acco rding to the equals() method\\nmust have the same hash code. In the Object class, this condition is satisﬁed because both\\nequals() and hashCode() are based on the address of the memory location where the obje ct\\nis stored. However, as noted in Subsection 10.1.6, many clas ses redeﬁne the equals() method.\\nIf a class redeﬁnes the equals() method, and if objects of that class will be used as keys in\\nhash tables, then the class should also redeﬁne the hashCode() method. F or example, in the\\nString class, the equals() method is redeﬁned so that two objects of type String are considered\\nto be equal if they contain the same sequence of characters. T he hashCode() method is also\\nredeﬁned in the String class, so that the hash code of a string is computed from the ch aracters\\nin that string rather than from its location in memory . F or Ja va’s standard classes, you can\\nexpect equals() and hashCode() to be correctly deﬁned. However, you might need to deﬁne'),\n",

PROGRAMMING WITH THE COLLECTION FRAMEWORK 511\\nthese methods in classes that you write yourself.\\n10.4 Programming with the Collection Framework\\nIn this section, we’ll look at some programming examples that use classes fro m the Java\\nCollection F ramework. The Collection F ramework is easy to u se, especially compared to the\\ndiﬃculty of programming new data structures from scratch.\\n10.4.1 Symbol T ables\\nW e begin with a straightforward but important application o f maps. When a compiler reads\\nthe source code of a program, it encounters deﬁnitions of var iables, subroutines, and classes.\\nThe names of these things can be used later in the program. The compiler has to remember the\\ndeﬁnition of each name, so that it can recognize the name and a pply the deﬁnition when the\\nname is encountered later in the program. This is a natural ap plication for a Map. The name\\ncan be used as a key in the map. The value associated to the key i s the deﬁnition of the name,\\nencoded somehow as an object. A map that is used in this way is c alled a symbol table .\\nIn a compiler, the values in a symbol table can be quite compli cated, since the compiler has\\nto deal with names for various sorts of things, and it needs a d iﬀerent type of information for\\neach diﬀerent type of name. W e will keep things simple by look ing at a symbol table in another\\ncontext. Suppose that we want a program that can evaluate exp ressions entered by the user,\\nand suppose that the expressions can contain variables, in a ddition to operators, numbers, and\\nparentheses. F or this to make sense, we need some way of assig ning values to variables. When\\na variable is used in an expression, we need to retrieve the va riable’s value. A symbol table can\\nbe used to store the data that we need. The keys for the symbol t able are variable names. The\\nvalue associated with a key is the value of that variable, whi ch is of type double. The symbol\\ntable will be an object of type Map<String,Double>. (Remember that primitive types such as\\ndouble can’t be used as type parameters; a wrapper class such as Double must be used instead.\\nSee Subsection 10.1.7.)\\nT o demonstrate the idea, we’ll use a rather simple-minded pr ogram in which the user types\\ncommands such as:\\nlet x = 3 + 12\\nprint 2 + 2\\nprint 10*x +17\\nlet rate = 0.06\\nprint 1000*(1+rate)\\nThe program is an interpreter for a very simple language. The only two commands that\\nthe program understands are “print” and “let”. When a “print ” command is executed, the\\ncomputer evaluates the expression and displays the value. I f the expression contains a variable,\\nthe computer has to look up the value of that variable in the sy mbol table. A “let” command\\nis used to give a value to a variable. The computer has to store the value of the variable in\\nthe symbol table. (Note: The “variables” I am talking about h ere are not variables in the Java\\nprogram. The Java program is executing a sort of program type d in by the user. I am talking\\nabout variables in the user’s program. The user gets to make u p variable names, so there is no\\nway for the Java program to know in advance what the variables will be.)\\nIn Subsection 9.5.2, we saw how to write a program, SimpleParser2.java, that can evaluate\\nexpressions that do not contain variables. Here, I will disc uss another example program, Sim-'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\npleInterpreter.java, that is based on the older program. I will only talk about the parts that\\nare relevant to the symbol table.\\nThe program uses a HashMap as the symbol table. A T reeMap could also be used, but since\\nthe program does not need to access the variables in alphabet ical order, we don’t need to have\\nthe keys stored in sorted order. The symbol table in the progr am is represented by a variable\\nnamed symbolTable of type HashMap<String,Double>. At the beginning of the program, the\\nsymbol table object is created with the command:\\nsymbolTable = new HashMap<String,Double>();\\nThis creates a map that initially contains no key/value asso ciations. T o execute a “let” com-\\nmand, the program uses the symbol table’s put() method to associate a value with the variable\\nname. Suppose that the name of the variable is given by a String, varName, and the value of\\nthe variable is stored in a variable val of type double. The following command would then set\\nthe value associated with the variable in the symbol table:\\nsymbolTable.put( varName, val );\\nIn the program SimpleInterpreter.java, you’ll ﬁnd this in the method named doLetCommand().\\nThe actual value that is stored in the symbol table is an objec t of type Double. W e can use the\\ndouble value val in the call to put because Java does an automatic conversion of type double\\nto Double when necessary . The double value is “wrapped” in an object of type Double, so that,\\nin eﬀect, the above statement is equivalent to\\nsymbolTable.put( varName, new Double(val) );\\nJust for fun, I decided to pre-deﬁne two variables named “pi” and “e” whose values are the\\nusual mathematical constants π and e. In Java, the values of these constants are given by\\nMath.PI and Math.E. T o make these variables available to the user of the program , they are\\nadded to the symbol table with the commands:\\nsymbolTable.put( \"pi\", Math.PI );\\nsymbolTable.put( \"e\", Math.E );\\nWhen the program encounters a variable while evaluating an e xpression, the symbol table’s\\nget() method is used to retrieve its value. The function symbolTable.get(varName) returns\\na value of type Double. It is possible that the return value is null; this will happen if no value\\nhas ever been assigned to varName in the symbol table. It’s important to check this possibilit y .\\nIt indicates that the user is trying to use a variable that the user has not deﬁned. The program\\nconsiders this to be an error, so the processing looks someth ing like this:\\nDouble val = symbolTable.get(varName);\\nif (val == null) {\\n... // Throw an exception: Undefined variable.\\n}\\n// The value associated to varName is val.doubleValue()\\nY ou will ﬁnd this code, more or less, in a method named primaryValue() in SimpleInter-\\npreter.java.\\nAs you can see from this example, Maps are very useful and are really quite easy to use.\\n10.4.2 Sets Inside a Map\\nThe objects in a collection or map can be of any type.

PROGRAMMING WITH THE COLLECTION FRAMEWORK 513\\nConsider the problem of making an index for a book. An index co nsists of a list of terms\\nthat appear in the book. Next to each term is a list of the pages on which that term appears.\\nT o represent an index in a program, we need a data structure th at can hold a list of terms,\\nalong with a list of pages for each term. Adding new data shoul d be easy and eﬃcient. When\\nit’s time to print the index, it should be easy to access the te rms in alphabetical order. There\\nare many ways this could be done, but I’d like to use Java’s gen eric data structures and let\\nthem do as much of the work as possible.\\nW e can think of an index as a Map that associates a list of page references to each term.\\nThe terms are keys, and the value associated with a given key i s the list of page references for\\nthat term. A Map can be either a T reeMap or a HashMap, but only a T reeMap will make it\\neasy to access the terms in sorted order. The value associate d with a term is a list of page\\nreferences. How can we represent such a value? If you think ab out it, you see that it’s not\\nreally a list in the sense of Java’s generic classes. If you lo ok in any index, you’ll see that a\\nlist of page references has no duplicates, so it’s really a se t rather than a list. F urthermore,\\nthe page references for a given term are always printed in inc reasing order, so we want a sorted\\nset. This means that we should use a T reeSet to represent each list of page references. The\\nvalues that we really want to put in this set are of type int, but once again we have to deal\\nwith the fact that generic data structures can only hold obje cts, so we must use the wrapper\\nclass, Integer, for the objects in the set.\\nT o summarize, an index will be represented by a T reeMap. The keys for the map will be\\nterms, which are of type String. The values in the map will be T reeSets that contain the Integers\\nwhich give the page numbers of every page on which a term appea rs. The parameterized type\\nthat we should use for the sets is T reeSet<Integer>. F or the T reeMap that represents the index\\nas a whole, the key type is String and the value type is T reeSet<Integer>. This means that the\\nindex has type\\nTreeMap< String, TreeSet<Integer> >\\nThis is just the usual T reeMap<T,S> with T=String and S=TreeSet<Integer>. A type name\\nas complicated as this one can look intimidating (especiall y , I think, when used in a constructor\\nwith the new operator), but if you think about the data structure that we w ant to represent, it\\nmakes sense. Given a little time and practice, you can get use d to types like this one.\\nT o make an index, we need to start with an empty T reeMap, look through the book, inserting\\nevery reference that we want to be in the index into the map, an d then print out the data from\\nthe map. Let’s leave aside the question of how we ﬁnd the refer ences to put in the index, and\\njust look at how the T reeMap is used. It can be created with the commands:\\nTreeMap<String,TreeSet<Integer>> index; // Declare the v ariable.\\nindex = new TreeMap<String,TreeSet<Integer>>(); // Creat e the map object.\\nNow, suppose that we ﬁnd a reference to some term (of type String ) on some pageNum (of\\ntype int). W e need to insert this information into the index. T o do thi s, we should look up the\\nterm in the index, using index.get(term). The return value is either null or is the set of page\\nreferences that we have previously found for the term. If the return value is null, then this is\\nthe ﬁrst page reference for the term, so we should add the term to the index, with a new set\\nthat contains the page reference we’ve just found. If the ret urn value is non- null, we already\\nhave a set of page references, and we should just add the new pa ge reference to the set. Here\\nis a subroutine that does this:\\n/**\\n* Add a page reference to the index.'),\n",

(T o be honest, I was sort of surprised that this worked\\nwhen I ﬁrst tried it!)\\nThis is not a lot of code, considering the complexity of the op erations. I have not written\\na complete indexing program, but Exercise 10.5 presents a pr oblem that is almost identical to\\nthe indexing problem.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nBy the way , in this example, I would prefer to print each list o f page references with the\\nintegers separated by commas. In the printIndex() method given above,they are separated\\nby spaces. There is an extra space after the last page referen ce in the list, but it does no harm\\nsince it’s invisible in the printout. An extra comma at the en d of the list would be annoying.\\nThe lists should be in a form such as “ 17,42,105” and not “ 17,42,105,”. The problem is, how\\nto leave that last comma out. Unfortunately , this is not so ea sy to do with a for-each loop. It\\nmight be fun to look at a few ways to solve this problem. One alt ernative is to use an iterator:\\nIterator<Integer> iter = pageSet.iterator();\\nint firstPage = iter.next(); // In this program, we know the s et has at least\\n// one element. Note also that this statement\\n// uses an auto-conversion from Integer to int.\\nSystem.out.print(firstPage);\\nwhile ( iter.hasNext() ) {\\nint nextPage = iter.next();\\nSystem.out.print(\",\" + nextPage);\\n}\\nAnother possibility is to use the fact that the T reeSet class deﬁnes a method first() that\\nreturns the ﬁrst item in the set, that is, the one that is small est in terms of the ordering that\\nis used to compare items in the set. (It also deﬁnes the method last().) W e can solve our\\nproblem using this method and a for-each loop:\\nint firstPage = pageSet.first(); // Find out the first page n umber in the set.\\nfor ( int page : pageSet ) {\\nif ( page != firstPage )\\nSystem.out.print(\",\"); // Output comma only if this is not the first page.\\nSystem.out.print(page);\\n}\\nFinally , here is an elegant solution using a subset view of th e tree. (See Subsection 10.3.2.)\\nActually , this solution might be a bit extreme:\\nint firstPage = pageSet.first(); // Get first item, which we know exists.\\nSystem.out.print(firstPage); // Print first item, with no comma.\\nfor ( int page : pageSet.tailSet( firstPage+1 ) ) // Process remaining items.\\nSystem.out.print( \",\" + page );\\n10.4.3 Using a Comparator\\nThere is a potential problem with our solution to the indexin g problem. If the terms in the index\\ncan contain both upper case and lower case letters, then the t erms will not be in alphabetical'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\norder! The ordering on String is not alphabetical. It is based on the Unicode codes of the\\ncharacters in the string. The codes for all the upper case let ters are less than the codes for\\nthe lower case letters. So, for example, terms beginning wit h “Z” come before terms beginning\\nwith “a”. If the terms are restricted to use lower case letter s only (or upper case only), then\\nthe ordering would be alphabetical. But suppose that we allo w both upper and lower case, and\\nthat we insist on alphabetical order. In that case, our index can’t use the usual ordering for\\nStrings. F ortunately , it’s possible to specify a diﬀerent method to be used for comparing the\\nkeys of a map. This is a typical use for a Comparator.\\nRecall that an object that implements the interface Comparator<T> deﬁnes a method for\\ncomparing two objects of type T :\\npublic int compare( T obj1, T obj2 )\\nThis method should return an integer that is positive, zero, or negative, depending on whether\\nobj1 is less than, equal to, or greater than obj2. W e need an object of type Comparator<String>\\nthat will compare two Strings based on alphabetical order. The easiest way to do this is to\\nconvert the Strings to lower case and use the default comparison on the lower case Strings. The\\nfollowing class deﬁnes such a comparator:\\n/**\\n* Represents a Comparator that can be used for comparing two\\n* strings based on alphabetical order.\\n*/\\nclass AlphabeticalOrder implements Comparator<String> {\\npublic int compare(String str1, String str2) {\\nString s1 = str1.toLowerCase(); // Convert to lower case.\\nString s2 = str2.toLowerCase();\\nreturn s1.compareTo(s2); // Compare lower-case Strings.\\n}\\n}\\nT o solve our indexing problem, we just need to tell our index t o use an object of type\\nAlphabeticalOrder for comparing keys. This is done by providing a Comparator object as a\\nparameter to the constructor. W e just have to create the index in our example with the\\ncommand:\\nindex = new TreeMap<String,TreeSet<Integer>>( new AlphabeticalOrder() );\\nThis does work. However, I’ve been concealing one technical ity . Suppose, for exam-\\nple, that the indexing program calls addReference(\"aardvark\",56) and that it later calls\\naddReference(\"Aardvark\",102). The words “aardvark” and “Aardvark” diﬀer only in that\\none of them begins with an upper case letter; when converted t o lower case, they are the same.\\nWhen we insert them into the index, do they count as two diﬀere nt terms or as one term? The\\nanswer depends on the way that a T reeMap tests objects for equality . In fact, T reeMaps and\\nT reeSets always use a Comparator object or a compareTo method to test for equality . They do\\nnot use the equals() method for this purpose. The Comparator that is used for the T reeMap\\nin this example returns the value zero when it is used to compa re “aardvark” and “Aardvark”,\\nso the T reeMap considers them to be the same. Page references to “aardvark” and “Aardvark”\\nare combined into a single list. This is probably the correct behavior in this example. If not,\\nsome other technique must be used to sort the terms into alpha betical order.'),\n",

PROGRAMMING WITH THE COLLECTION FRAMEWORK 517\\n10.4.4 Word Counting\\nThe ﬁnal example in this section also deals with storing info rmation about words. The problem\\nhere is to make a list of all the words that occur in a ﬁle, along with the number of times that\\neach word occurs. The ﬁle will be selected by the user. The out put of the program will consist\\nof two lists. Each list contains all the words from the ﬁle, al ong with the number of times that\\nthe word occurred. One list is sorted alphabetically , and th e other is sorted according to the\\nnumber of occurrences, with the most common words at the top a nd the least common at the\\nbottom. The problem here is a generalization of Exercise 7.6 , which asked you to make an\\nalphabetical list of all the words in a ﬁle, without counting the number of occurrences.\\nMy word counting program can be found in the ﬁle WordCount.java. As the program reads\\nan input ﬁle, it must keep track of how many times it encounter s each word. W e could simply\\nthrow all the words, with duplicates, into a list and count th em later. But that would require\\na lot of storage and would not be very eﬃcient. A better method is to keep a counter for each\\nword. The ﬁrst time the word is encountered, the counter is in itialized to 1. On subsequent\\nencounters, the counter is incremented. T o keep track of the data for one word, the program\\nuses a simple class that holds a word and the counter for that w ord. The class is a static\\nnested class:\\n/**\\n* Represents the data we need about a word: the word and\\n* the number of times it has been encountered.\\n*/\\nprivate static class WordData {\\nString word;\\nint count;\\nWordData(String w) {\\n// Constructor for creating a WordData object when\\n// we encounter a new word.\\nword = w;\\ncount = 1; // The initial value of count is 1.\\n}\\n} // end class WordData\\nThe program has to store all the WordData objects in some sort of data structure. W e want\\nto be able to add new words eﬃciently . Given a word, we need to c heck whether a WordData\\nobject already exists for that word, and if it does, we need to ﬁnd that object so that we can\\nincrement its counter. A Map can be used to implement these operations. Given a word, we\\nwant to look up a WordData object in the Map. This means that the word is the key, and the\\nWordData object is the value. (It might seem strange that the key is also one of the instance\\nvariables in the value object, but in fact this is probably th e most common situation: The\\nvalue object contains all the information about some entity , and the key is one of those pieces\\nof information; the partial information in the key is used to retrieve the full information in the\\nvalue object.) After reading the ﬁle, we want to output the wo rds in alphabetical order, so we\\nshould use a T reeMap rather than a HashMap. This program converts all words to lower case\\nso that the default ordering on Strings will put the words in alphabetical order. The data is\\nstored in a variable named words of type T reeMap<String,WordData>. The variable is declared\\nand the map object is created with the statement:\\nTreeMap<String,WordData> words = new TreeMap<String,WordData>();'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\nWhen the program reads a word from a ﬁle, it calls words.get(word) to ﬁnd out if that\\nword is already in the map. If the return value is null, then this is the ﬁrst time the word\\nhas been encountered, so a new WordData object is created and inserted into the map with the\\ncommand words.put(word, new WordData(word)). If words.get(word) is not null, then\\nits value is the WordData object for this word, and the program only has to increment th e\\ncounter in that object. The program uses a method readNextWord(), which was given in\\nExercise 7.6, to read one word from the ﬁle. This method retur ns null when the end of the ﬁle\\nis encountered. Here is the complete code segment that reads the ﬁle and collects the data:\\nString word = readNextWord();\\nwhile (word != null) {\\nword = word.toLowerCase(); // convert word to lower case\\nWordData data = words.get(word);\\nif (data == null)\\nwords.put( word, new WordData(word) );\\nelse\\ndata.count++;\\nword = readNextWord();\\n}\\nAfter reading the words and printing them out in alphabetica l order, the program has to\\nsort the words by frequency and print them again. T o do the sor ting using a generic algorithm, I\\ndeﬁned a simple Comparator class for comparing two word objects according to their freq uency\\ncounts. The class implements the interface Comparator<WordData>, since it will be used to\\ncompare two objects of type WordData:\\n/**\\n* A comparator class for comparing objects of type WordData according to\\n* their counts. This is used for sorting the list of words by fr equency.\\n*/\\nprivate static class CountCompare implements Comparator<WordData> {\\npublic int compare(WordData data1, WordData data2) {\\nreturn data2.count - data1.count;\\n// The return value is positive if data2.count > data1.count.\\n// I.E., data1 comes after data2 in the ordering if there\\n// were more occurrences of data2.word than of data1.word.\\n// The words are sorted according to decreasing counts.\\n}\\n} // end class CountCompare\\nGiven this class, we can sort the WordData objects according to frequency by ﬁrst copying\\nthem into a list and then using the generic method Collections.sort(list,comparator).\\nThe WordData objects that we need are the values in the map, words. Recall that\\nwords.values() returns a Collection that contains all the values from the map. The con-\\nstructor for the ArrayList class lets you specify a collection to be copied into the list when it is\\ncreated. So, we can use the following commands to create a lis t of type ArrayList<WordData>\\ncontaining the word data and then sort that list according to frequency:\\nArrayList<WordData> wordsByFrequency = new ArrayList<WordData>( words.values() );\\nCollections.sort( wordsByFrequency, new CountCompare() );\\nY ou should notice that these two lines replace a lot of code! I t requires some practice to think\\nin terms of generic data structures and algorithms, but the p ayoﬀ is signiﬁcant in terms of saved\\ntime and eﬀort.'),\n",

WRITING GENERIC CLASSES AND METHODS 519\\nThe only remaining problem is to print the data. W e have to pri nt the data from all the\\nWordData objects twice, ﬁrst in alphabetical order and then sorted ac cording to frequency\\ncount. The data is in alphabetical order in the T reeMap, or more precisely , in the values of\\nthe T reeMap. W e can use a for-each loop to print the data in the collection words.values(),\\nand the words will appear in alphabetical order. Another for -each loop can be used to print\\nthe data in the list wordsByFrequency, and the words will be printed in order of decreasing\\nfrequency . Here is the code that does it:\\nTextIO.putln(\"List of words in alphabetical order\"\\n+ \" (with counts in parentheses):\\\\n\");\\nfor ( WordData data : words.values() )\\nTextIO.putln(\" \" + data.word + \" (\" + data.count + \")\");\\nTextIO.putln(\"\\\\n\\\\nList of words by frequency of occurrence:\\\\n\");\\nfor ( WordData data : wordsByFrequency )\\nTextIO.putln(\" \" + data.word + \" (\" + data.count + \")\");\\nY ou can ﬁnd the complete word-counting program in the ﬁle WordCount.java. Note that for\\nreading and writing ﬁles, it uses the ﬁle I/O capabilities of TextIO.java, which were discussed\\nin Subsection 2.4.5.\\nBy the way , if you run the W ordCount program on a reasonably la rge ﬁle and take a look\\nat the output, it will illustrate something about the Collections.sort() method. The second\\nlist of words in the output is ordered by frequency , but if you look at a group of words that all\\nhave the same frequency , you will see that the words in that gr oup are in alphabetical order.\\nThe method Collections.sort() was applied to sort the words by frequency , but before it was\\napplied, the words were already in alphabetical order. When Collections.sort() rearranged\\nthe words, it did not change the ordering of words that have th e same frequency , so they were\\nstill in alphabetical order within the group of words with th at frequency . This is because the\\nalgorithm used by Collections.sort() is a stable sorting algorithm. A sorting algorithm is\\nsaid to be stable if it satisﬁes the following condition: Whe n the algorithm is used to sort a list\\naccording to some property of the items in the list, then the s ort does not change the relative\\norder of items that have the same value of that property . That is, if item B comes after item A\\nin the list before the sort, and if both items have the same val ue for the property that is being\\nused as the basis for sorting, then item B will still come afte r item A after the sorting has\\nbeen done. Neither SelectionSort nor QuickSort are stable s orting algorithms. Insertion sort is\\nstable, but is not very fast. The sorting algorithm used by Collections.sort() is both stable\\nand fast.\\nI hope that the programming examples in this section have con vinced you of the usefulness\\nof the Java Collection F ramework!\\n10.5 W riting Generic Classes and Methods\\nSo far in this chapter, you have learned about using the generic classes and methods that\\nare part of the Java Collection F ramework. Now, it’s time to l earn how to write new generic\\nclasses and methods from scratch. Generic programming prod uces highly general and reusable\\ncode—it’s very useful for people who write reusable softwar e libraries to know how to do generic\\nprogramming, since it enables them to write code that can be u sed in many diﬀerent situations.\\nNot every programmer needs to write reusable software libra ries, but every programmer should\\nknow at least a little about how to do it.

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\nJava’s standard generic classes, you need to know some of the syntax that is introduced in this\\nsection.\\nI will not cover every detail of generic programming in Java i n this section, but the material\\npresented here should be suﬃcient to cover the most common ca ses.\\n10.5.1 Simple Generic Classes\\nLet’s start with an example that illustrates the motivation for generic programming. In Subsec-\\ntion 10.2.1, I remarked that it would be easy to use a LinkedList to implement a queue. (Queues\\nwere introduced in Subsection 9.3.2.) T o ensure that the onl y operations that are performed\\non the list are the queue operations enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty, we can create a new class\\nthat contains the linked list as a private instance variable . T o implement queues of strings, for\\nexample, we can deﬁne the class:\\nclass QueueOfStrings {\\nprivate LinkedList<String> items = new LinkedList<String>();\\npublic void enqueue(String item) {\\nitems.addLast(item);\\n}\\npublic String dequeue() {\\nreturn items.removeFirst();\\n}\\npublic boolean isEmpty() {\\nreturn (items.size() == 0);\\n}\\n}\\nThis is a ﬁne and useful class. But, if this is how we write queu e classes, and if we want\\nqueues of Integers or Doubles or JButtons or any other type, then we will have to write a\\ndiﬀerent class for each type. The code for all of these classe s will be almost identical, which\\nseems like a lot of redundant programming. T o avoid the redun dancy , we can write a generic\\nQueue class that can be used to deﬁne queues of any type of object.\\nThe syntax for writing the generic class is straightforward : W e replace the speciﬁc type\\nString with a type parameter such as T, and we add the type parameter to the name of the\\nclass:\\nclass Queue<T> {\\nprivate LinkedList<T> items = new LinkedList<T>();\\npublic void enqueue(T item) {\\nitems.addLast(item);\\n}\\npublic T dequeue() {\\nreturn items.removeFirst();\\n}\\npublic boolean isEmpty() {\\nreturn (items.size() == 0);\\n}\\n}\\nNote that within the class, the type parameter T is used just like any regular type name.\\nIt’s used to declare the return type for dequeue, as the type of the formal parameter item in\\nenqueue, and even as the actual type parameter in LinkedList<T>. Given this class deﬁnition, we\\ncan use parameterized types such as Queue<String> and Queue<Integer> and Queue<JButton>.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'AFPL Ghostscript 8.51', 'creator': 'dvips(k) 5.95b Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software', 'creationdate': 'D:20071115202101', 'moddate': 'D:20071115202101', 'title': 'javanotes.dvi', 'source': '../data/rag_data/javanotes5.pdf', 'total_pages': 699, 'page': 536, 'page_label': '537', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='10.5. WRITING GENERIC CLASSES AND METHODS 521\\nThat is, the Queue class is used in exactly the same way as built-in generic clas ses like LinkedList\\nand HashSet.\\nNote that you don’t have to use “T” as the name of the type param eter in the deﬁnition of\\nthe generic class. Type parameters are like formal paramete rs in subroutines. Y ou can make up\\nany name you like in the deﬁnition of the class. The name in the deﬁnition will be replaced by\\nan actual type name when the class is used to declare variable s or create objects. If you prefer\\nto use a more meaningful name for the type parameter, you migh t deﬁne the Queue class as:\\nclass Queue<ItemType> {\\nprivate LinkedList<ItemType> items = new LinkedList<ItemType>();\\npublic void enqueue(ItemType item) {\\nitems.addLast(item);\\n}\\npublic ItemType dequeue() {\\nreturn items.removeFirst();\\n}\\npublic boolean isEmpty() {\\nreturn (items.size() == 0);\\n}\\n}\\nChanging the name from “ T” to “ ItemType” has absolutely no eﬀect on the meaning of the\\nclass deﬁnition or on the way that Queue is used.\\nGeneric interfaces can be deﬁned in a similar way . It’s also e asy to deﬁne generic classes\\nand interfaces that have two or more type parameters, as is do ne with the standard interface\\nMap<T,S>. A typical example is the deﬁnition of a “Pair” that contains two objects, possibly\\nof diﬀerent types. A simple version of such a class can be deﬁn ed as:\\nclass Pair<T,S> {\\npublic T first;\\npublic S second;\\npublic Pair( T a, S b ) { // Constructor.\\nfirst = a;\\nsecond = b;\\n}\\n}\\nThis class can be used to declare variables and create object s such as:\\nPair<String,Color> colorName = new Pair<String,Color>(\"Red\", Color.RED);\\nPair<Double,Double> coordinates = new Pair<Double,Double>(17.3,42.8);\\nNote that in the deﬁnition of the constructor in this class, t he name “ Pair” does not have type\\nparameters. Y ou might have expected “ Pair<T,S>. However, the name of the class is “ Pair”,\\nnot “ Pair<T,S>, and within the deﬁnition of the class, “ T” and “ S” are used as if they are the\\nnames of speciﬁc, actual types. Note in any case that type par ameters are never added to the\\nnames of methods or constructors, only to the names of classe s and interfaces.\\n10.5.2 Simple Generic Methods\\nIn addition to generic classes, Java also has generic method s. An example is the method\\nCollections.sort(), which can sort collections of objects of any type. T o see how to write\\ngeneric methods, let’s start with a non-generic method for c ounting the number of times that\\na given string occurs in an array of strings:'),\n",

By writing a generic method, we get\\nto write a single method deﬁnition that will work for objects of any type. W e need to replace\\nthe speciﬁc type String in the deﬁnition of the method with a the name of a type paramet er,\\nsuch as T. However, if that’s the only change we make, the compiler wil l think that “T” is\\nthe name of an actual type, and it will mark it as an undeclared identiﬁer. W e need some\\nway of telling the compiler that “T” is a type parameter. That ’s what the “ <T>” does in the\\ndeﬁnition of the generic class “ class Queue<T> { ...”. F or a generic method, the “ <T>” goes\\njust before the name of the return type of the method:\\npublic static <T> int countOccurrences(T[] list, T itemToCount) {\\nint count = 0;\\nif (itemToCount == null) {\\nfor ( T listItem : list )\\nif (listItem == null)\\ncount++;\\n}\\nelse {\\nfor ( T listItem : list )\\nif (itemToCount.equals(listItem))\\ncount++;\\n}\\nreturn count;\\n}\\nThe “ <T>” marks the method as being generic and speciﬁes the name of th e type parameter\\nthat will be used in the deﬁnition. Of course, the name of the t ype parameter doesn’t have to\\nbe “T”; it can be anything. (The “ <T>” looks a little strange in that position, I know, but it\\nhad to go somewhere and that’s just where the designers of Jav a decided to put it.)\\nGiven the generic method deﬁnition, we can apply it to object s of any type. If wordList is\\na variable of type String[ ] and word is a variable of type String, then\\nint ct = countOccurrences( wordList, word );'),\n",

If palette is a variable of type\\nColor[ ] and color is a variable of type Color, then\\nint ct = countOccurrences( palette, color );\\nwill count the number of times that color occurs in palette. If numbers is a variable of type\\nInteger[ ], then\\nint ct = countOccurrences( numbers, 17 );\\nwill count the number of times that 17 occurs in numbers. This last example uses au-\\ntoboxing; the 17 is automatically converted to a value of typ e Integer, as if we had said\\n“ countOccurrences( numbers, new Integer(17) )”. Note that, since generic programming\\nin Java applies only to objects, we cannot use countOccurrences to count the number of\\noccurrences of 17 in an array of type int[ ].\\nA generic method can have one or more type parameters, such as the “T” in\\ncountOccurrences. Note that when a generic method is used, as in the function ca ll\\n“ countOccurrences(wordlist, word)”, there is no explicit mention of the type that is sub-\\nstituted for the type parameter. The compiler deduces the ty pe from the types of the actual\\nparameters in the method call. Since wordlist is of type String[ ], the compiler can tell that\\nin “ countOccurrences(wordlist, word)”, the type that replaces T is String. This contrasts\\nwith the use of generic classes, as in “ new Queue<String>()”, where the type parameter is\\nspeciﬁed explicitly .\\nThe countOccurrences method operates on an array .

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\nin the Comparable interface. What we need is a way of specifying that a generic c lass or method\\nonly applies to objects of type Comparable and not to arbitrary objects. With that restriction,\\nwe should be free to use compareTo() in the deﬁnition of the generic class or method.\\nThere are two diﬀerent but related syntaxes for putting rest rictions on the types that are\\nused in generic programming. One of these is bounded type parameters , which are used\\nas formal type parameters in generic class and method deﬁnit ions; a bounded type parameter\\nwould be used in place of the simple type parameter T in “ class GenericClass<T> ...”\\nor in “ public static <T> void genericMethod(...”. The second syntax is wildcard\\ntypes, which are used as type parameters in the declarations of var iables and of formal\\nmethod parameters; a wildcard type could be used in place of t he type parameter String\\nin the declaration statement “ List<String> list;” or in the formal parameter list “ void\\nmax(Collection<String> c)”. W e will look at wildcard types ﬁrst, and we will return to th e\\ntopic of bounded types later in this section.\\nLet’s start with a simple example in which a wildcard type is u seful. Suppose that Shape\\nis a class that deﬁnes a method public void draw(), and suppose that Shape has subclasses\\nsuch as Rect and Oval. Suppose that we want a method that can draw all the shapes in a\\ncollection of Shapes. W e might try:\\npublic static void drawAll(Collection<Shape> shapes) {\\nfor ( Shape s : shapes )\\ns.draw();\\n}\\nThis method works ﬁne if we apply it to a variable of type Collection<Shape>, or Ar-\\nrayList<Shape>, or any other collection class with type parameter Shape. Suppose, however,\\nthat you have list of Rects stored in a variable named rectangles of type Collection<Rect>.\\nSince Rects are Shapes, you might expect to be able to call drawAll(rectangles). Unfortu-\\nnately , this will not work; a collection of Rects is not considered to be a collection of Shapes !\\nThe variable rectangles cannot be assigned to the formal parameter shapes. The solution\\nis to replace the type parameter “ Shape” in the declaration of shapes with the wildcard type\\n“ ? extends Shape”:\\npublic static void drawAll(Collection<? extends Shape> shapes) {\\nfor ( Shape s : shapes )\\ns.draw();\\n}\\nThe wildcard type “ ? extends Shape” means roughly “any type that is either equal to Shape\\nor that is a subclass of Shape ”. When the parameter shapes is declared to be of type Collec-\\ntion<? extends Shape >, it becomes possible to call the drawAll method with an actual parameter\\nof type Collection<Rect> since Rect is a subclass of Shape and therefore matches the wildcard\\n“ ? extends Shape”. W e could also pass actual parameters to drawAll of type ArrayList<Rect>\\nor Set<Oval> or List<Oval>. And we can still pass variables of type Collection<Shape> or Ar-\\nrayList<Shape>, since the class Shape itself matches “ ? extends Shape”. W e have greatly\\nincreased the usefulness of the method by using the wildcard type.\\n(Although it is not essential, you might be interested in kno wing why Java does not allow\\na collection of Rects to be used as a collection of Shapes, even though every Rect is considered\\nto be a Shape. Consider the rather silly but legal method that adds an oval to a list of shapes:\\nstatic void addOval(List<Shape> shapes, Oval oval) {\\nshapes.add(oval);\\n}'),\n",

WRITING GENERIC CLASSES AND METHODS 525\\nSuppose that rectangles is of type List<Rect>. It’s illegal to call addOval(rectangles,oval),\\nbecause of the rule that a list of Rects is not a list of Shapes. If we dropped that rule, then\\naddOval(rectangles,oval) would be legal, and it would add an Oval to a list of Rects. This\\nwould be bad: Since Oval is not a subclass of Rect, an Oval is not a Rect, and a list of Rects\\nshould never be able to contain an Oval. The method call addOval(rectangles,oval) does\\nnot make sense and should be illegal, so the rule that a collection of Rects is not a collection\\nof Shapes is a good rule.)\\nAs another example, consider the method addAll() from the interface Collection<T>. In\\nmy description of this method in Subsection 10.1.4, I say tha t for a collection, coll, of type\\nCollection<T>, coll.addAll(coll2) “adds all the objects in coll2 to coll. The parameter,\\ncoll2, can be any collection of type Collection<T>. However, it can also be more general. F or\\nexample, if T is a class and S is a sub-class of T, then coll2 can be of type Collection<S>.\\nThis makes sense because any object of type S is automatically of type T and so can legally\\nbe added to coll.” If you think for a moment, you’ll see that what I’m describi ng here, a little\\nawkwardly , is a use of wildcard types: W e don’t want to requir e coll2 to be a collection of of\\nobjects of type T ; we want to allow collections of any subclass of T. T o be more speciﬁc, let’s\\nlook at how a similar addAll() method could be added to the generic Queue class that was\\ndeﬁned earlier in this section:\\nclass Queue<T> {\\nprivate LinkedList<T> items = new LinkedList<T>();\\npublic void enqueue(T item) {\\nitems.addLast(item);\\n}\\npublic T dequeue() {\\nreturn items.removeFirst();\\n}\\npublic boolean isEmpty() {\\nreturn (items.size() == 0);\\n}\\npublic void addAll(Collection<? extends T> collection) {\\n// Add all the items from the collection to the end of the queue\\nfor ( T item : collection )\\nenqueue(item);\\n}\\n}\\nHere, T is a type parameter in the generic class deﬁnition. W e are com bining wildcard\\ntypes with generic classes. Inside the generic class deﬁnit ion, “ T” is used as if it is a speciﬁc,\\nthough unknown, type. The wildcard type “ ? extends T” means some type that extends that\\nspeciﬁc type. When we create a queue of type Queue<Shape>, “ T” refers to “Shape”, and the\\nwildcard type “ ? extends T” in the class deﬁnition means “ ? extends Shape”, meaning that\\nthe addAll method of the queue can be applied to collections of Rects and Ovals as well as to\\ncollections of Shapes.\\nThe for-each loop in the deﬁnition of addAll iterates through the collection using a\\nvariable, item, of type T. Now, collection can be of type Collection<S>, where S is a subclass\\nof T. Since item is of type T, not S, do we have a problem here? No, no problem. As long as\\nS is a subclass of T, a value of type S can be assigned to a variable of type T. The restriction\\non the wildcard type makes everything work nicely .'),\n",

GENERIC PROGRAMMING AND COLLECTION CLASSES\\nThe addAll method adds all the items from a collection to the queue. Supp ose that we\\nwanted to do the opposite: Add all the items that are currentl y on the queue to a given\\ncollection. An instance method deﬁned as\\npublic void addAllTo(Collection<T> collection)\\nwould only work for collections whose base type is exactly th e same as T. This is too restrictive.\\nW e need some sort of wildcard. However, “ ? extends T” won’t work. Suppose we try it:\\npublic void addAllTo(Collection<? extends T> collection) {\\n// Remove all items currently on the queue and add them to collection\\nwhile ( ! isEmpty() ) {\\nT item = dequeue(); // Remove an item from the queue.\\ncollection.add( item ); // Add it to the collection. ILLEGAL!!\\n}\\n}\\nThe problem is that we can’t add an item of type T to a collection that might only be able\\nto hold items belonging to some subclass, S, of T. The containment is going in the wrong\\ndirection: An item of type T is not necessarily of type S. F or example, if we have a queue of\\ntype Queue<Shape>, it doesn’t make sense to add items from the queue to a collect ion of type\\nCollection<Rect>, since not every Shape is a Rect. On the other hand, if we have a Queue<Rect>,\\nit would make sense to add items from that queue to a Collection<Shape> or indeed to any\\ncollection Collection<S> where S is a superclass of Rect.\\nT o express this type of relationship, we need a new kind of typ e wildcard: “ ? super T”.\\nThis wildcard means, roughly , “either T itself or any class that is a superclass of T.” F or\\nexample, Collection<? super Rect > would match the types Collection<Shape>, ArrayList<Object>,\\nand Set<Rect>. This is what we need for our addAllTo method. With this change, our complete\\ngeneric queue class becomes:\\nclass Queue<T> {\\nprivate LinkedList<T> items = new LinkedList<T>();\\npublic void enqueue(T item) {\\nitems.addLast(item);\\n}\\npublic T dequeue() {\\nreturn items.removeFirst();\\n}\\npublic boolean isEmpty() {\\nreturn (items.size() == 0);\\n}\\npublic void addAll(Collection<? extends T> collection) {\\n// Add all the items from the collection to the end of the queue\\nfor ( T item : collection )\\nenqueue(item);\\n}\\npublic void addAllTo(Collection<? super T> collection) {\\n// Remove all items currently on the queue and add them to collection\\nwhile ( ! isEmpty() ) {\\nT item = dequeue(); // Remove an item from the queue.\\ncollection.add( item ); // Add it to the collection.\\n}\\n}\\n}'),\n",

Note\\nthat the term “ extends” (not “ implements”) is used in the wildcard type, even if T is an\\ninterface. F or example, recall that Runnable is an interface that deﬁnes the method public\\nvoid run(). Runnable objects are usually associated with threads (see Section 8.5). Here is a\\nmethod that runs all the objects in a collection of Runnables in parallel, by creating a separate\\nthread for each object:\\npublic static runAllInParallel( Collection<? extends Runnable> runnables ) {\\nfor ( Runnable runnable : runnables ) {\\nThread runner; // A thread to run the method runnable.run()\\nrunner = new Thread( runnable ); // Create the thread.\\nrunner.start(); // Start the thread running.\\n}\\n}\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nWildcard types are used only as type parameters in parameterized types, such as Collec-\\ntion<? extends Runnable >. The place where a wildcard type is most likely to occur, by fa r, is\\nin a formal parameter list, where the wildcard type is used in the declaration of the type of a\\nformal parameter. However, they can also be used in a few othe r places. F or example, they can\\nbe used in the type speciﬁcation in a variable declaration st atement.\\nOne ﬁnal remark: The wildcard type “ <?>” is equivalent to “ <? extends Object>”. That\\nis, it matches any possible type. F or example, the removeAll() method in the generic interface\\nCollections<T> is declared as\\npublic boolean removeAll( Collection<?> c ) { ...\\nThis just means that the removeAll method can be applied to any collection of any type of\\nobject.\\n10.5.4 Bounded Types\\nWildcard types don’t solve all of our problems. They allow us to generalize method deﬁnitions\\nso that they can work with collections of objects of various t ypes, rather than just a single type.\\nHowever, they do not allow us to restrict the types that are al lowed as type parameters in a\\ngeneric class or method deﬁnition. Bounded types exist for t his purpose.\\nW e start with a small, not very realistic example. Suppose th at you would like to cre-\\nate groups of GUI components using a generic class named ComponentGroup. F or example,\\nthe parameterized type ComponentGroup<JButton> would represent a group of JButtons, while\\nComponentGroup<JPanel> would represent a group of JPanels. The class will include methods\\nthat can be called to apply certain operations to all compone nts in the group at once. F or\\nexample, there will be a instance method of the form\\npublic void repaintAll() {\\n.\\n. // Call the repaint() method of every component in the group .\\n.\\n}\\nThe problem is that the repaint() method is deﬁned in any JComponent object, but not for ob-\\njects of arbitrary type. It wouldn’t make sense to allow type s such as ComponentGroup<String>\\nor ComponentGroup<Integer>, since Strings and Integers don’t have repaint() methods. W e'),\n",

The type SomeT ype doesn’t have to be the name of a\\nclass. It can be anything that represents an actual type. F or example, it can be an interface\\nor even a parameterized type.\\nBounded types and wildcard types are clearly related. They a re, however, used in very\\ndiﬀerent ways. A bounded type can be used only as a formal type parameter in the deﬁnition\\nof a generic method, class, or interface. A wildcard type is u sed most often to declare the type\\nof a formal parameter in a method and cannot be used as a formal type parameter. One other\\ndiﬀerence, by the way , is that, in contrast to wildcard types , bounded type parameters can only\\nuse “ extends”, never “ super”.\\nBounded type parameters can be used when declaring generic m ethods. F or example, as\\nan alternative to the generic ComponentGroup class, one could write a free-standing generic\\nstatic method that can repaint any collection of JComponents as follows:\\npublic static <T extends JComponent> void repaintAll(Collection<T> comps) {\\nfor ( JComponent c : comps )\\nif (c != null)\\nc.repaint();'),\n",

W e can write an\\nequivalent method using a wildcard type:\\npublic static void repaintAll(Collection<? extends JComponent> comps) {\\nfor ( JComponent c : comps )\\nif (c != null)\\nc.repaint();\\n}\\nIn this situation, the version that uses the wildcard type is to be preferred, since the implemen-\\ntation is simpler. However, there are some situations where a generic method with a bounded\\ntype parameter cannot be rewritten using a wildcard type. No te that a generic type parameter\\ngives a name, such as T, to the unknown type, while a wildcard type does not give a nam e to\\nthe unknown type. The name makes it possible to refer to the un known type in the body of\\nthe method that is being deﬁned. If a generic method deﬁnitio n uses the generic type name\\nmore than once or uses it outside the formal parameter list of the method, then the generic\\ntype cannot be replaced with a wildcard type.\\nLet’s look at a generic method in which a bounded type paramet er is essential. In Subsec-\\ntion 10.2.1, I presented a code segment for inserting a strin g into a sorted list of strings, in such\\na way that the modiﬁed list is still in sorted order. Here is th e same code, but this time in the\\nform of a method deﬁnition (and without the comments):\\nstatic void sortedInsert(List<String> sortedList, String newItem) {\\nListIterator<String> iter = sortedList.listIterator();\\nwhile (iter.hasNext()) {\\nString item = iter.next();\\nif (newItem.compareTo(item) <= 0) {\\niter.previous();\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\niter.add(newItem);\\n}\\nThis method works ﬁne for lists of strings, but it would be nic e to have a generic method\\nthat can be applied to lists of other types of objects. The pro blem, of course, is that the code\\nassumes that the compareTo() method is deﬁned for objects in the list, so the method can\\nonly work for lists of objects that implement the Comparable interface. W e can’t simply use\\na wildcard type to enforce this restriction. Suppose we try t o do it, by replacing List<String>\\nwith List<? extends Comparable >:\\nstatic void sortedInsert(List<? extends Comparable> sortedList, ???? newItem) {\\nListIterator<????> iter = stringList.listIterator();\\n...\\nW e immediately run into a problem, because we have no name for the unknown type represented\\nby the wildcard. W e need a name for that type because the type of newItem and of iter should\\nbe the same as the type of the items in the list. The problem is s olved if we write a generic'),\n",

Comparable is itself a parameterized\\ntype, but I have used it here without a type parameter.

The name of the class sho uld be Predicates, in analogy\\nwith the standard class Collections that provides various static methods for working with\\ncollections.\\npublic static <T> void remove(Collection<T> coll, Predicate<T> pred)\\n// Remove every object, obj, from coll for which\\n// pred.test(obj) is true.\\npublic static <T> void retain(Collection<T> coll, Predicate<T> pred)\\n// Remove every object, obj, from coll for which\\n// pred.test(obj) is false. (That is, retain the\\n// objects for which the predicate is true.)\\npublic static <T> List<T> collect(Collection<T> coll, Predicate<T> pred)\\n// Return a List that contains all the objects, obj,\\n// from the collection, coll, such that pred.test(obj)\\n// is true.\\npublic static <T> int find(ArrayList<T> list, Predicate<T> pred)\\n// Return the index of the first item in list\\n// for which the predicate is true, if any.\\n// If there is no such item, return -1.\\n(In C++, methods similar to these are included as a standard p art of the generic pro-\\ngramming framework.)\\n5. An example in Subsection 10.4.2 concerns the problem of maki ng an index for a book.\\nA related problem is making a concordance for a document. A concordance lists every\\nword that occurs in the document, and for each word it gives th e line number of every\\nline in the document where the word occurs. All the subroutin es for creating an index\\nthat were presented in Subsection 10.4.2 can also be used to c reate a concordance. The\\nonly real diﬀerence is that the integers in a concordance are line numbers rather than page\\nnumbers.\\nW rite a program that can create a concordance. The document s hould be read from\\nan input ﬁle, and the concordance data should be written to an output ﬁle. Y ou can use\\nthe indexing subroutines from Subsection 10.4.2, modiﬁed t o write the data to TextIO\\ninstead of to System.out. (Y ou will need to make these subroutines static.)

This interaction is referred to as input/output, or I/O. Up until now, this book has\\nconcentrated on just one type of interaction: interaction w ith the user, through either a graph-\\nical user interface or a command-line interface. But the use r is only one possible source of\\ninformation and only one possible destination for informat ion. W e have already encountered\\none other type of input/output, since T extIO can read data from ﬁles and write data to ﬁles.\\nHowever, Java has an input/output framework that provides m uch more power and ﬂexibility\\nthan does T extIO, and that covers other kinds of I/O in addition to ﬁles. Most i mportantly , it\\nsupports communication over network connections. In Java, input/output involving ﬁles and\\nnetworks is based on streams, which are objects that support I/O commands that are simila r\\nto those that you have already used. In fact, standard output (System.out) and standard input\\n(System.in) are examples of streams.\\nW orking with ﬁles and networks requires familiarity with ex ceptions, which were covered in\\nChapter 8. Many of the subroutines that are used can throw exc eptions that require mandatory\\nexception handling. This generally means calling the subro utine in a try..catch statement\\nthat can deal with the exception if one occurs.\\n11.1 Streams, Readers, and W riters\\nWithout the ability to interact with the rest of the world, a program would be usel ess.\\nThe interaction of a program with the rest of the world is refe rred to as input/output or I/O.\\nHistorically , one of the hardest parts of programming langu age design has been coming up with\\ngood facilities for doing input and output. A computer can be connected to many diﬀerent\\ntypes of input and output devices. If a programming language had to deal with each type of\\ndevice as a special case, the complexity would be overwhelmi ng. One of the major achievements\\nin the history of programming has been to come up with good abs tractions for representing\\nI/O devices. In Java, the main I/O abstractions are called streams. Other I/O abstractions,\\nsuch as “ﬁles” and “channels” also exist, but in this section we will look only at streams. Every\\nstream represents either a source of input or a destination t o which output can be sent.\\n11.1.1 Character and Byte Streams\\nWhen dealing with input/output, you have to keep in mind that there are two broad categories\\nof data: machine-formatted data and human-readable data. M achine-formatted data is repre-\\nsented in binary form, the same way that data is represented i nside the computer, that is, as\\n537'),\n",

When you read a\\nnumber such as 3.141592654, you are reading a sequence of characters and interpreting t hem\\nas a number. The same number would be represented in the compu ter as a bit-string that you\\nwould ﬁnd unrecognizable.\\nT o deal with the two broad categories of data representation , Java has two broad categories\\nof streams: byte streams for machine-formatted data and character streams for human-\\nreadable data. There are many predeﬁned classes that repres ent streams of each type.\\nAn object that outputs data to a byte stream belongs to one of the subclasses of the\\nabstract class OutputStream. Objects that read data from a byte stream belong to subclasses\\nof InputStream. If you write numbers to an OutputStream, you won’t be able to read the\\nresulting data yourself. But the data can be read back into th e computer with an InputStream.\\nThe writing and reading of the data will be very eﬃcient, sinc e there is no translation involved:\\nthe bits that are used to represent the data inside the comput er are simply copied to and from\\nthe streams.\\nF or reading and writing human-readable character data, the main classes are the abstract\\nclasses Reader and Writer. All character stream classes are subclasses of one of these . If a\\nnumber is to be written to a Writer stream, the computer must translate it into a human-\\nreadable sequence of characters that represents that numbe r. Reading a number from a Reader\\nstream into a numeric variable also involves a translation, from a character sequence into the\\nappropriate bit string. (Even if the data you are working wit h consists of characters in the\\nﬁrst place, such as words from a text editor, there might stil l be some translation. Characters\\nare stored in the computer as 16-bit Unicode values. F or peop le who use W estern alphabets,\\ncharacter data is generally stored in ﬁles in ASCII code, whi ch uses only 8 bits per character.\\nThe Reader and Writer classes take care of this translation, and can also handle no n-western\\nalphabets in countries that use them.)\\nByte streams can be useful for direct machine-to-machine co mmunication, and they can\\nsometimes be useful for storing data in ﬁles, especially whe n large amounts of data need to be\\nstored eﬃciently , such as in large databases. However, bina ry data is fragile in the sense that its\\nmeaning is not self-evident. When faced with a long series of zeros and ones, you have to know\\nwhat information it is meant to represent and how that inform ation is encoded before you will\\nbe able to interpret it. Of course, the same is true to some ext ent for character data, which is\\nitself coded into binary form. But the binary encoding of cha racter data has been standardized\\nand is well understood, and data expressed in character form can be made meaningful to human\\nreaders. The current trend seems to be towards increased use of character data, represented in\\na way that will make its meaning as self-evident as possible. W e’ll look at how this is done in\\nSection 11.6.\\nI should note that the original version of Java did not have ch aracter streams, and that\\nfor ASCII-encoded character data, byte streams are largely interchangeable with character\\nstreams. In fact, the standard input and output streams, System.in and System.out, are byte\\nstreams rather than character streams. However, you should use Readers and Writers rather\\nthan InputStreams and OutputStreams when working with character data.\\nThe standard stream classes discussed in this section are de ﬁned in the package java.io,\\nalong with several supporting classes. Y ou must import the classes from this package if you\\nwant to use them in your program. That means either importing individual classes or putting\\nthe directive “ import java.io.*;” at the beginning of your source ﬁle. Streams are necessary\\nfor working with ﬁles and for doing communication over a netw ork. They can be also used\\nfor communication between two concurrently running thread s, and there are stream classes for'),\n",

F or example, the InputStream class declares the instance method\\npublic int read() throws IOException\\nfor reading one byte of data, as a number in the range 0 to 255, f rom an input stream. If the\\nend of the input stream is encountered, the read() method will return the value -1 instead. If\\nsome error occurs during the input attempt, an exception of t ype IOException is thrown. Since\\nIOException is an exception class that requires mandatory exception-ha ndling, this means that\\nyou can’t use the read() method except inside a try statement or in a subroutine that is itself\\ndeclared with a “ throws IOException” clause. (Mandatory exception handling was covered in\\nSubsection 8.3.4.)\\nThe InputStream class also deﬁnes methods for reading several bytes of data i n one step into\\nan array of bytes. However, InputStream provides no convenient methods for reading other\\ntypes of data, such as int or double, from a stream. This is not a problem because you’ll never\\nuse an object of type InputStream itself. Instead, you’ll use subclasses of InputStream that add\\nmore convenient input methods to InputStream’s rather primitive capabilities. Similarly , the\\nOutputStream class deﬁnes a primitive output method for writing one byte o f data to an output\\nstream. The method is deﬁned as:\\npublic void write(int b) throws IOException\\nThe parameter is of type int rather than byte, but the parameter value is type-cast to type\\nbyte before it is written; this eﬀectively discards all but the ei ght low order bytes of b. Again,\\nin practice, you will almost always use higher-level output operations deﬁned in some subclass\\nof OutputStream.\\nThe Reader and Writer classes provide identical low-level read and write methods. As in\\nthe byte stream classes, the parameter of the write(c) method in Writer and the return value\\nof the read() method in Reader are of type int, but in these character-oriented classes, the I/O\\noperations read and write characters rather than bytes. The return value of read() is -1 if the\\nend of the input stream has been reached. Otherwise, the retu rn value must be type-cast to\\ntype char to obtain the character that was read. In practice, you will u se ordinarily use higher\\nlevel I/O operations provided by sub-classes of Reader and Writer, as discussed below.\\n11.1.2 PrintWriter\\nOne of the neat things about Java’s I/O package is that it lets you add capabilities to a stream\\nby “wrapping” it in another stream object that provides thos e capabilities. The wrapper object\\nis also a stream, so you can read from or write to it—but you can do so using fancier operations\\nthan those available for basic streams.\\nF or example, PrintWriter is a subclass of Writer that provides convenient methods for out-\\nputting human-readable character representations of all o f Java’s basic data types. If you have\\nan object belonging to the Writer class, or any of its subclasses, and you would like to use\\nPrintWriter methods to output data to that Writer, all you have to do is wrap the Writer in a\\nPrintWriter object. Y ou do this by constructing a new PrintWriter object, using the Writer as\\ninput to the constructor. F or example, if charSink is of type Writer, then you could say'),\n",

Y ou’ve\\njust provided a better interface to the same output stream. F or example, this allows you to use\\nPrintWriter methods to send data to a ﬁle or over a network connection.\\nF or the record, if out is a variable of type PrintWriter, then the following methods are\\ndeﬁned:\\n• out.print(x) — prints the value of x, represented in the form of a string of characters,\\nto the output stream; x can be an expression of any type, including both primitive ty pes\\nand object types. An object is converted to string form using its toString() method. A\\nnull value is represented by the string “null”.\\n• out.println() — outputs an end-of-line to the output stream.\\n• out.println(x) — outputs the value of x, followed by an end-of-line; this is equivalent\\nto out.print(x) followed by out.println().\\n• out.printf(formatString, x1, x2, ...) — does formated output of x1, x2, ... to\\nthe output stream. The ﬁrst parameter is a string that speciﬁ es the format of the output.\\nThere can be any number of additional parameters, of any type , but the types of the\\nparameters must match the formatting directives in the form at string. F ormatted output\\nfor the standard output stream, System.out, was introduced in Subsection 2.4.4, and\\nout.printf has the same functionality .\\nNote that none of these methods will ever throw an IOException. Instead, the PrintWriter\\nclass includes the method\\npublic boolean checkError()\\nwhich will return true if any error has been encountered while writing to the stream . The\\nPrintWriter class catches any IOExceptions internally , and sets the value of an internal error ﬂag\\nif one occurs. The checkError() method can be used to check the error ﬂag. This allows you\\nto use PrintWriter methods without worrying about catching exceptions. On the other hand, to\\nwrite a fully robust program, you should call checkError() to test for possible errors whenever\\nyou used a PrintWriter.\\n11.1.3 Data Streams\\nWhen you use a PrintWriter to output data to a stream, the data is converted into the sequ ence\\nof characters that represents the data in human-readable fo rm. Suppose you want to output\\nthe data in byte-oriented, machine-formatted form? The java.io package includes a byte-\\nstream class, DataOutputStream that can be used for writing data values to streams in interna l,\\nbinary-number format. DataOutputStream bears the same relationship to OutputStream that\\nPrintWriter bears to Writer. That is, whereas OutputStream only has methods for outputting\\nbytes, DataOutputStream has methods writeDouble(double x) for outputting values of type\\ndouble, writeInt(int x) for outputting values of type int, and so on. F urthermore, you can\\nwrap any OutputStream in a DataOutputStream so that you can use the higher level output\\nmethods on it. F or example, if byteSink is of type OutputStream, you could say\\nDataOutputStream dataSink = new DataOutputStream(byteSink);'),\n",

Y ou can wrap any InputStream in a DataIn-\\nputStream object to provide it with the ability to read data of various t ypes from the byte-\\nstream. The methods in the DataInputStream for reading binary data are called readDouble(),\\nreadInt(), and so on. Data written by a DataOutputStream is guaranteed to be in a format\\nthat can be read by a DataInputStream. This is true even if the data stream is created on one\\ntype of computer and read on another type of computer. The cro ss-platform compatibility of\\nbinary data is a major aspect of Java’s platform independenc e.\\nIn some circumstances, you might need to read character data from an InputStream or write\\ncharacter data to an OutputStream. This is not a problem, since characters, like all data, are\\nrepresented as binary numbers. However, for character data , it is convenient to use Reader and\\nWriter instead of InputStream and OutputStream. T o make this possible, you can wrap a byte\\nstream in a character stream. If byteSource is a variable of type InputStream and byteSink is\\nof type OutputStream, then the statements\\nReader charSource = new InputStreamReader( byteSource );\\nWriter charSink = new OutputStreamWriter( byteSink );\\ncreate character streams that can be used to read character d ata from and write character\\ndata to the byte streams. In particular, the standard input s tream System.in, which is of\\ntype InputStream for historical reasons, can be wrapped in a Reader to make it easier to read\\ncharacter data from standard input:\\nReader charIn = new InputStreamReader( System.in );\\nAs another application, the input and output streams that ar e associated with a network\\nconnection are byte streams rather than character streams, but the byte streams can be wrapped\\nin character streams to make it easy to send and receive chara cter data over the network. W e\\nwill encounter network I/O in Section 11.4.\\n11.1.4 Reading T ext\\nStill, the fact remains that much I/O is done in the form of hum an-readable characters. In\\nview of this, it is surprising that Java does not provide a standard character input class that\\ncan read character data in a manner that is reasonably symmet rical with the character output\\ncapabilities of PrintWriter. There is one basic case that is easily handled by a standard c lass.\\nThe BuﬀeredReader class has a method\\npublic String readLine() throws IOException\\nthat reads one line of text from its input source. If the end of the stream has been reached, the\\nreturn value is null. When a line of text is read, the end-of-line marker is read fr om the input\\nstream, but it is not part of the string that is returned. Diﬀe rent input streams use diﬀerent\\ncharacters as end-of-line markers, but the readLine method can deal with all the common cases.\\n(T raditionally , Unix computers, including Linux and Mac OS X, use a line feed character, ’\\\\n’,\\nto mark an end of line; classic Macintosh used a carriage retu rn character, ’\\\\r’; and Windows\\nuses the two-character sequence “ \\\\r\\\\n”.

The try..catch statement is necessary because the readLine method\\ncan throw an exception of type IOException, which requires mandatory exception handling; an\\nalternative to try..catch would be to declare that the method that contains the code “ throws\\nIOException”. Also, remember that BuﬀeredReader , InputStreamReader, and IOException must\\nbe imported from the package java.io.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nPreviously in this book, we have used the non-standard class T extIO for input both from\\nusers and from ﬁles. The advantage of T extIO is that it makes it fairly easy to read data values\\nof any of the primitive types. Disadvantages include the fac t that T extIO can only read from\\none ﬁle at a time, that it can’t do I/O operations on network co nnections, and that it does not\\nfollow the same pattern as Java’s built-in input/output cla sses.\\nI have written a class named T extReader to ﬁx some of these disadvantages, while providing\\ninput capabilities similar to those of T extIO. Like T extIO, T extReader is a non-standard class,\\nso you have to be careful to make it available to any program th at uses it. The source code for\\nthe class can be found in the ﬁle TextReader.java\\nJust as for many of Java’s stream classes, an object of type T extReader can be used as a\\nwrapper for an existing input stream, which becomes the sour ce of the characters that will\\nbe read by the T extReader. (Unlike the standard classes, however, a T extReader is not itself a\\nstream and cannot be wrapped inside other stream classes.) T he constructors\\npublic TextReader(Reader characterSource)\\nand\\npublic TextReader(InputStream byteSource)\\ncreate objects that can be used to read human-readable data f rom the given Reader or In-\\nputStream using the convenient input methods of the T extReader class. In T extIO, the input\\nmethods were static members of the class. The input methods i n the T extReader class are\\ninstance methods. The instance methods in a T extReader object read from the data source that\\nwas speciﬁed in the object’s constructor. This makes it poss ible for several T extReader objects\\nto exist at the same time, reading from diﬀerent streams; as a result, T extReader can be used\\nto read data from more than one ﬁle at the same time.'),\n",

STREAMS, READERS, AND WRITERS 543\\nA T extReader object has essentially the same set of input methods as the T extIO class.\\nOne big diﬀerence is how errors are handled. When a T extReader encounters an error in the\\ninput, it throws an exception of type IOException. This follows the standard pattern that is\\nused by Java’s standard input streams. IOExceptions require mandatory exception handling,\\nso T extReader methods are generally called inside try..catch statements. If an IOException\\nis thrown by the input stream that is wrapped inside a T extReader, that IOException is simply\\npassed along. However, other types of errors can also occur. One such possible error is an\\nattempt to read data from the input stream when there is no mor e data left in the stream. A\\nT extReader throws an exception of type T extReader.EndOfStreamException when this happens.\\nThe exception class in this case is a nested class in the T extReader class; it is a subclass of\\nIOException, so a try..catch statement that handles IOExceptions will also handle end-of-\\nstream exceptions. However, having a class to represent end -of-stream errors makes it possible\\nto detect such errors and provide special handling for them. Another type of error occurs\\nwhen a T extReader tries to read a data value of a certain type, and the next item i n the input\\nstream is not of the correct type. In this case, the T extReader throws an exception of type\\nT extReader.BadDataException, which is another subclass of IOException.\\nF or reference, here is a list of some of the more useful instan ce methods in the T extReader\\nclass. All of these methods can throw exceptions of type IOException:\\n• public char peek() — looks ahead at the next character in the input stream, and re turns\\nthat character. The character is not removed from the stream . If the next character is an\\nend-of-line, the return value is ’ \\\\n’. It is legal to call this method even if there is no more\\ndata left in the stream; in that case, the return value is the c onstant TextReader.EOF.\\n(“EOF” stands for “End-Of-File,” a term that is more commonl y used than “End-Of-\\nStream”, even though not all streams are ﬁles.)\\n• public boolean eoln() and public boolean eof()— convenience methods for testing\\nwhether the next thing in the ﬁle is an end-of-line or an end-o f-ﬁle. Note that these\\nmethods do not skip whitespace. If eof() is false, you know that there is still at least\\none character to be read, but there might not be any more non-blank characters in the\\nstream.\\n• public void skipBlanks() and public void skipWhiteSpace() — skip past whites-\\npace characters in the input stream; skipWhiteSpace() skips all whitespace characters,\\nincluding end-of-line while skipBlanks() only skips spaces and tabs.\\n• public String getln() — reads characters up to the next end-of-line (or end-of-str eam),\\nand returns those characters in a string. The end-of-line ma rker is read but it not part of\\nthe returned string. This will throw an exception if there ar e no more characters in the\\nstream.\\n• public char getAnyChar() — reads and returns the next character from the stream.\\nThe character can be a whitespace character such as a blank or end-of-line. If this method\\nis called after all the characters in the stream have been rea d, an exception is thrown.\\n• public int getlnInt(), public double getlnDouble(), public char getlnChar(),\\netc. — skip any whitespace characters in the stream, includi ng end-of-lines, then read a\\nvalue of the speciﬁed type, which will be the return value of t he method. Any remaining\\ncharacters on the line are then discarded, including the end -of-line marker. There is a\\nmethod for each primitive type. An exception occurs if it’s n ot possible to read a data\\nvalue of the requested type.\\n• public int getInt(), public double getDouble(), public char getChar(), etc. —'),\n",

An exception occurs if it’s not possible to read a data v alue of the requested type.\\n11.1.5 The Scanner Class\\nSince its introduction, Java has been notable for its lack of built-in support for basic input,\\nand for its reliance on fairly advanced techniques for the su pport that it does oﬀer. (This is my\\nopinion, at least.) The Scanner class was introduced in Java 5.0 to make it easier to read basi c\\ndata types from a character input source. It does not (again, in my opinion) solve the problem\\ncompletely , but it is a big improvement. The Scanner class is in the package java.util.\\nInput routines are deﬁned as instance methods in the Scanner class, so to use the class, you\\nneed to create a Scanner object. The constructor speciﬁes the source of the characte rs that the\\nScanner will read. The scanner acts as a wrapper for the input source. The source can be a\\nReader, an InputStream, a String, or a File. (If a String is used as the input source, the Scanner\\nwill simply read the characters in the string from beginning to end, in the same way that it\\nwould process the same sequence of characters from a stream. The File class will be covered in\\nthe next section.) F or example, you can use a Scanner to read from standard input by saying:\\nScanner standardInputScanner = new Scanner( System.in );\\nand if charSource is of type Reader, you can create a Scanner for reading from charSource\\nwith:\\nScanner scanner = new Scanner( charSource );\\nWhen processing input, a scanner usually works with tokens. A token is a meaningful\\nstring of characters that cannot, for the purposes at hand, b e further broken down into smaller\\nmeaningful pieces. A token can, for example, be an individua l word or a string of characters\\nthat represents a value of type double. In the case of a scanner, tokens must be separated by\\n“delimiters.” By default, the delimiters are whitespace ch aracters such as spaces and end-of-line\\nmarkers. In normal processing, whitespace characters serv e simply to separate tokens and are\\ndiscarded by the scanner. A scanner has instance methods for reading tokens of various types.\\nSuppose that scanner is an object of type Scanner. Then we have:\\n• scanner.next() — reads the next token from the input source and returns it as a String.\\n• scanner.nextInt(), scanner.nextDouble(), and so on — reads the next token from the\\ninput source and tries to convert it to a value of type int, double, and so on. There are\\nmethods for reading values of any of the primitive types.\\n• scanner.nextLine() — reads an entire line from the input source, up to the next end -\\nof-line and returns the line as a value of type String. The end-of-line marker is read but\\nis not part of the return value. Note that this method is not based on tokens. An entire\\nline is read and returned, including any whitespace charact ers in the line.\\nAll of these methods can generate exceptions. If an attempt i s made to read past the\\nend of input, an exception of type NoSuchElementException is thrown. Methods such as\\nscanner.getInt() will throw an exception of type InputMismatchException if the next to-\\nken in the input does not represent a value of the requested ty pe. The exceptions that can be\\ngenerated do not require mandatory exception handling.'),\n",

STREAMS, READERS, AND WRITERS 545\\nThe Scanner class has very nice look-ahead capabilities. Y ou can query a scanner to de-\\ntermine whether more tokens are available and whether the ne xt token is of a given type. If\\nscanner is of type Scanner :\\n• scanner.hasNext() — returns a boolean value that is true if there is at least one more\\ntoken in the input source.\\n• scanner.hasNextInt(), scanner.hasNextDouble(), and so on — returns a boolean\\nvalue that is true if there is at least one more token in the inp ut source and that token\\nrepresents a value of the requested type.\\n• scanner.hasNextLine() — returns a boolean value that is true if there is at least one\\nmore line in the input source.\\nAlthough the insistence on deﬁning tokens only in terms of de limiters limits the usability\\nof scanners to some extent, they are easy to use and are suitab le for many applications.\\n11.1.6 Serialized Object I/O\\nThe classes PrintWriter, T extReader, Scanner, DataInputStream, and DataOutputStream allow\\nyou to easily input and output all of Java’s primitive data ty pes. But what happens when you\\nwant to read and write objects? T raditionally , you would have to come up with some way of\\nencoding your object as a sequence of data values belonging t o the primitive types, which can\\nthen be output as bytes or characters. This is called serializing the object. On input, you\\nhave to read the serialized data and somehow reconstitute a c opy of the original object. F or\\ncomplex objects, this can all be a major chore. However, you c an get Java to do all the work\\nfor you by using the classes ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream. These are subclasses\\nof InputStream and Outputstream that can be used for writing and reading serialized objects.\\nObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream are wrapper classes that can be wrapped around\\narbitrary InputStreams and OutputStreams. This makes it possible to do object input and output\\non any byte stream. The methods for object I/O are readObject(), in ObjectInputStream,\\nand writeObject(Object obj), in ObjectOutputStream. Both of these methods can throw\\nIOExceptions. Note that readObject() returns a value of type Object, which generally has to\\nbe type-cast to a more useful type.\\nObjectOutputStream also has methods writeInt(), writeDouble(), and so on, for out-\\nputting primitive type values to the stream, and ObjectInputStream has corresponding methods\\nfor reading primitive type values.\\nObject streams are byte streams. The objects are represente d in binary , machine-readable\\nform. This is good for eﬃciency , but it does suﬀer from the fra gility that is often seen in\\nbinary data. They suﬀer from the additional problem that the binary format of Java objects is\\nvery speciﬁc to Java, so the data in object streams is not easi ly available to programs written\\nin other programming languages. F or these reasons, object s treams are appropriate mostly\\nfor short-term storage of objects and for transmitting obje cts over a network connection from\\none Java program to another. F or long-term storage and for co mmunication with non-Java\\nprograms, other approaches to object serialization are usu ally better. (See Subsection 11.6.2\\nfor a character-based approach.)\\nObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream only work with objects that implement an in-\\nterface named Serializable. F urthermore, all of the instance variables in the object mu st be\\nserializable. However, there is little work involved in mak ing an object serializable, since the\\nSerializable interface does not declare any methods. It exists only as a ma rker for the compiler,'),\n",

Many of Java’s standard classes a re\\nalready declared to be serializable, including all the comp onent classes and many other classes\\nin Swing and in the A WT. One of the programming examples in Sec tion 11.3 uses object IO.\\n11.2 Files\\nThe data and programsin a computer’s main memory survive only as long as the power i s\\non. F or more permanent storage, computers use ﬁles , which are collections of data stored on\\na hard disk, on a USB memory stick, on a CD-ROM, or on some other type of storage device.\\nFiles are organized into directories (sometimes called folders). A directory can hold other\\ndirectories, as well as ﬁles. Both directories and ﬁles have names that are used to identify them.\\nPrograms can read data from existing ﬁles. They can create ne w ﬁles and can write data\\nto ﬁles. In Java, such input and output can be done using strea ms. Human-readable character\\ndata is read from a ﬁle using an object belonging to the class FileReader, which is a subclass of\\nReader. Similarly , data is written to a ﬁle in human-readable forma t through an object of type\\nFileWriter, a subclass of Writer. F or ﬁles that store data in machine format, the appropriate I/O\\nclasses are FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. In this section, I will only discuss character-\\noriented ﬁle I/O using the FileReader and FileWriter classes. However, FileInputStream and\\nFileOutputStream are used in an exactly parallel fashion. All these classes ar e deﬁned in the\\njava.io package.\\nIt’s worth noting right at the start that applets which are do wnloaded over a network\\nconnection are not allowed to access ﬁles (unless you have ma de a very foolish change to your\\nweb browser’s conﬁguration). This is a security considerat ion. Y ou can download and run an\\napplet just by visiting a W eb page with your browser. If downl oaded applets had access to\\nthe ﬁles on your computer, it would be easy to write an applet t hat would destroy all the data\\non a computer that downloads it. T o prevent such possibiliti es, there are a number of things\\nthat downloaded applets are not allowed to do. Accessing ﬁle s is one of those forbidden things.\\nStandalone programs written in Java, however, have the same access to your ﬁles as any other\\nprogram. When you write a standalone Java application, you c an use all the ﬁle operations\\ndescribed in this section.\\n11.2.1 Reading and Writing Files\\nThe FileReader class has a constructor which takes the name of a ﬁle as a param eter and\\ncreates an input stream that can be used for reading from that ﬁle. This constructor will throw\\nan exception of type FileNotFoundException if the ﬁle doesn’t exist. It requires mandatory\\nexception handling, so you have to call the constructor in a try..catch statement (or inside a\\nroutine that is declared to throw the exception). F or exampl e, suppose you have a ﬁle named\\n“ data.txt”, and you want your program to read data from that ﬁle. Y ou cou ld do the following\\nto create an input stream for the ﬁle:\\nFileReader data; // (Declare the variable before the\\n// try statement, or else the variable\\n// is local to the try block and you won’t\\n// be able to use it later in the program.)\\ntry {\\ndata = new FileReader(\"data.txt\"); // create the stream'),\n",

More generally , just about any error\\nthat can occur during input/output operations can be caught by a catch clause that handles\\nIOException.\\nOnce you have successfully created a FileReader, you can start reading data from it. But\\nsince FileReaders have only the primitive input methods inherited from the bas ic Reader class,\\nyou will probably want to wrap your FileReader in a Scanner, in a T extReader, or in some\\nother wrapper class. (The T extReader class is not a standard part of Java; it is described\\nin Subsection 11.1.4. Scanner is discussed in Subsection 11.1.5.) T o create a T extReader for\\nreading from a ﬁle named data.dat, you could say:\\nTextReader data;\\ntry {\\ndata = new TextReader( new FileReader(\"data.dat\") );\\n}\\ncatch (FileNotFoundException e) {\\n... // handle the exception\\n}\\nOnce you have a T extReader named data, you can read from it using such methods as\\ndata.getInt() and data.peek(), exactly as you would from any other T extReader.\\nW orking with output ﬁles is no more diﬃcult than this. Y ou sim ply create an object\\nbelonging to the class FileWriter. Y ou will probably want to wrap this output stream in an objec t\\nof type PrintWriter. F or example, suppose you want to write data to a ﬁle named “ result.dat”.\\nSince the constructor for FileWriter can throw an exception of type IOException, you should use\\na try..catch statement:\\nPrintWriter result;\\ntry {\\nresult = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(\"result.dat\"));\\n}\\ncatch (IOException e) {\\n... // handle the exception\\n}\\nIf no ﬁle named result.dat exists, a new ﬁle will be created. If the ﬁle already exists, t hen\\nthe current contents of the ﬁle will be erased and replaced wi th the data that your program\\nwrites to the ﬁle. This will be done without any warning. T o av oid overwriting a ﬁle that\\nalready exists, you can check whether a ﬁle of the same name al ready exists before trying\\nto create the stream, as discussed later in this section. An IOException might occur in the\\nPrintWriter constructor if, for example, you are trying to create a ﬁle on a disk that is “write-\\nprotected,” meaning that it cannot be modiﬁed.\\nAfter you are ﬁnished using a ﬁle, it’s a good idea to close the ﬁle, to tell the operating\\nsystem that you are ﬁnished using it. Y ou can close a ﬁle by cal ling the close() method of\\nthe associated stream.

If\\nyou forget to close a ﬁle, the ﬁle will ordinarily be closed au tomatically when the program\\nterminates or when the ﬁle object is garbage collected, but i n the case of an output ﬁle, some\\nof the data that has been written to the ﬁle might be lost. This can occur because data that\\nis written to a ﬁle can be buﬀered ; that is, the data is not sent immediately to the ﬁle but\\nis retained in main memory (in a “buﬀer”) until a larger chunk of data is ready to be written.\\nThis is done for eﬃciency . The close() method of an output stream will cause all the data in\\nthe buﬀer to be sent to the ﬁle.

T o fully specify\\na ﬁle, you have to give both the name of the ﬁle and the name of th e directory where that\\nﬁle is located. A simple ﬁle name like “data.dat” or “result. dat” is taken to refer to a ﬁle in\\na directory that is called the current directory (also known as the “default directory” or\\n“working directory”). The current directory is not a perman ent thing. It can be changed by\\nthe user or by a program. Files not in the current directory mu st be referred to by a path\\nname, which includes both the name of the ﬁle and information abou t the directory where it\\ncan be found.\\nT o complicate matters even further, there are two types of pa th names, absolute path\\nnames and relative path names . An absolute path name uniquely identiﬁes one ﬁle among\\nall the ﬁles available to the computer. It contains full info rmation about which directory the\\nﬁle is in and what the ﬁle’s name is. A relative path name tells the computer how to locate the\\nﬁle starting from the current directory .\\nUnfortunately , the syntax for ﬁle names and path names varie s somewhat from one type of\\ncomputer to another. Here are some examples:\\n• data.dat — on any computer, this would be a ﬁle named “data.dat” in the c urrent\\ndirectory .\\n• /home/eck/java/examples/data.dat — This is an absolute path name in a UNIX op-\\nerating system, including Linux and Mac OS X.

FILES AND NETWORKING\\n• C:\\\\eck\\\\java\\\\examples\\\\data.dat — An absolute path name on a Windows computer.\\n• Hard Drive:java:examples:data.dat — Assuming that “Hard Drive” is the name of a\\ndisk drive, this would be an absolute path name on a computer u sing a classic Macintosh\\noperating system such as Mac OS 9.\\n• examples/data.dat — a relative path name under UNIX. “Examples” is the name of a\\ndirectory that is contained within the current directory , a nd data.data is a ﬁle in that direc-\\ntory . The corresponding relative path name for Windows woul d be examples\\\\data.dat.\\n• ../examples/data.dat — a relative path name in UNIX that means “go to the directory\\nthat contains the current directory , then go into a director y named examples inside that\\ndirectory , and look there for a ﬁle named data.data.” In gene ral, “ ..” means “go up one\\ndirectory .”\\nIt’s reasonably safe to say , though, that if you stick to usin g simple ﬁle names only , and if the\\nﬁles are stored in the same directory with the program that wi ll use them, then you will be\\nOK. Later in this section, we’ll look at a convenient way of le tting the user specify a ﬁle in a\\nGUI program, which allows you to avoid the issue of path names altogether.\\nIt is possible for a Java program to ﬁnd out the absolute path n ames for two important\\ndirectories, the current directory and the user’s home dire ctory . The names of these directories\\nare system properties , and they can be read using the function calls:\\n• System.getProperty(\"user.dir\") — returns the absolute path name of the current\\ndirectory as a String.\\n• System.getProperty(\"user.home\") — returns the absolute path name of the user’s home\\ndirectory as a String.\\nT o avoid some of the problems caused by diﬀerences in path nam es between platforms, Java\\nhas the class java.io.File. An object belonging to this class represents a ﬁle. More pre cisely ,\\nan object of type File represents a ﬁle name rather than a ﬁle as such. The ﬁle to which the\\nname refers might or might not exist. Directories are treate d in the same way as ﬁles, so a File\\nobject can represent a directory just as easily as it can repr esent a ﬁle.\\nA File object has a constructor, new File(String), that creates a File object from a path\\nname. The name can be a simple name, a relative path, or an abso lute path. F or example,\\nnew File(\"data.dat\")creates a File object that refers to a ﬁle named data.dat, in the current\\ndirectory . Another constructor, new File(File,String), has two parameters. The ﬁrst is a\\nFile object that refers to the directory that contains the ﬁle. Th e second can be the name of\\nthe ﬁle or a relative path from the directory to the ﬁle.\\nFile objects contain several useful instance methods. Assuming that file is a variable of\\ntype File, here are some of the methods that are available:\\n• file.exists() — This boolean-valued function returns true if the ﬁle named by the\\nFile object already exists. Y ou can use this method if you want to a void overwriting the\\ncontents of an existing ﬁle when you create a new FileWriter.\\n• file.isDirectory() — This boolean-valued function returns true if the File object\\nrefers to a directory . It returns false if it refers to a regular ﬁle or if no ﬁle with the given\\nname exists.\\n• file.delete() — Deletes the ﬁle, if it exists. Returns a boolean value to indicate whether\\nthe ﬁle was successfully deleted.'),\n",

Otherwis e, it returns\\nnull.\\nHere, for example, is a program that will list the names of all the ﬁles in a directory speciﬁed\\nby the user. Just for fun, I have used a Scanner (Subsection 11.1.5) to read the user’s input:\\nimport java.io.File;\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\n/**\\n* This program lists the files in a directory specified by\\n* the user.

If your program lets the user type in the ﬁle n ame, you will just have to\\nassume that the user understands how to work with ﬁles and dir ectories. But in a graphical\\nuser interface, the user expects to be able to select ﬁles usi ng a ﬁle dialog box , which is a\\nwindow that a program can open when it wants the user to select a ﬁle for input or output.\\nSwing includes a platform-independent technique for using ﬁle dialog boxes in the form of a\\nclass called JFileChooser. This class is part of the package javax.swing. W e looked at using\\nsome basic dialog boxes in Subsection 6.8.2. File dialog box es are similar to those, but are a\\nlittle more complicated to use.\\nA ﬁle dialog box shows the user a list of ﬁles and sub-director ies in some directory , and makes\\nit easy for the user to specify a ﬁle in that directory . The use r can also navigate easily from\\none directory to another. The most common constructor for JFileChooser has no parameter\\nand sets the starting directory in the dialog box to be the use r’s home directory . There are also\\nconstructors that specify the starting directory explicit ly:\\nnew JFileChooser( File startDirectory )\\nnew JFileChooser( String pathToStartDirectory )\\nConstructing a JFileChooser object does not make the dialog box appear on the screen.\\nY ou have to call a method in the object to do that. There are two diﬀerent methods that\\ncan be used because there are two types of ﬁle dialog: An open ﬁle dialog allows the user\\nto specify an existing ﬁle to be opened for reading data into t he program; a save ﬁle dialog\\nlets the user specify a ﬁle, which might or might not already e xist, to be opened for writing\\ndata from the program. File dialogs of these two types are ope ned using the showOpenDialog\\nand showSaveDialog methods. These methods make the dialog box appear on the scre en; the\\nmethods do not end until the user selects a ﬁle or cancels the d ialog.\\nA ﬁle dialog box always has a parent, another component which is associated with the\\ndialog box. The parent is speciﬁed as a parameter to the showOpenDialog or showSaveDialog\\nmethods. The parent is a GUI component, and can often be speci ﬁed as “ this” in prac-\\ntice, since ﬁle dialogs are often used in instance methods of GUI component classes. (The\\nparameter can also be null, in which case an invisible component is created to be used\\nas the parent.) Both showOpenDialog and showSaveDialog have a return value, which\\nwill be one of the constants JFileChooser.CANCEL\\nOPTION, JFileChooser.ERROR OPTION, or\\nJFileChooser.APPROVE OPTION. If the return value is JFileChooser.APPROVE OPTION, then\\nthe user has selected a ﬁle. If the return value is something e lse, then the user did not select a\\nﬁle. The user might have clicked a “Cancel” button, for examp le. Y ou should always check the\\nreturn value, to make sure that the user has, in fact, selecte d a ﬁle. If that is the case, then you\\ncan ﬁnd out which ﬁle was selected by calling the JFileChooser ’s getSelectedFile() method,\\nwhich returns an object of type File that represents the selected ﬁle.'),\n",

The main eﬀect of\\nthis is that the dialog box will keep the same selected direct ory from one call of readFile()\\nto the next. When the dialog reappears, it will show the same d irectory that the user selected\\nthe previous time it appeared. This is probably what the user expects.\\nNote that it’s common to do some conﬁguration of a JFileChooser before\\ncalling showOpenDialog or showSaveDialog. F or example, the instance method\\nsetDialogTitle(String) is used to specify a title to appear in the title bar of the wind ow.\\nAnd setSelectedFile(File) is used to set the ﬁle that is selected in the dialog box when\\nit appears. This can be used to provide a default ﬁle choice fo r the user. In the readFile()\\nmethod, above, fileDialog.setSelectedFile(null) speciﬁes that no ﬁle is pre-selected when\\nthe dialog box appears.\\nW riting data to a ﬁle is similar, but it’s a good idea to add a ch eck to determine whether\\nthe output ﬁle that is selected by the user already exists. In that case, ask the user whether to\\nreplace the ﬁle. Here is a typical subroutine for writing to a user-selected ﬁle:'),\n",

PROGRAMMING WITH FILES 555\\n11.3.1 Copying a File\\nAs a ﬁrst example, we look at a simple command-line program th at can make a copy of a\\nﬁle. Copying a ﬁle is a pretty common operation, and every ope rating system already has a\\ncommand for doing it. However, it is still instructive to loo k at a Java program that does the\\nsame thing. Many ﬁle operations are similar to copying a ﬁle, except that the data from the\\ninput ﬁle is processed in some way before it is written to the o utput ﬁle. All such operations\\ncan be done by programs with the same general form.\\nSince the program should be able to copy any ﬁle, we can’t assu me that the data in the\\nﬁle is in human-readable form. So, we have to use InputStream and OutputStream to operate\\non the ﬁle rather than Reader and Writer. The program simply copies all the data from the\\nInputStream to the OutputStream, one byte at a time. If source is the variable that refers to\\nthe InputStream, then the function source.read() can be used to read one byte. This function\\nreturns the value -1 when all the bytes in the input ﬁle have be en read. Similarly , if copy refers\\nto the OutputStream, then copy.write(b) writes one byte to the output ﬁle. So, the heart of\\nthe program is a simple while loop. As usual, the I/O operations can throw exceptions, so t his\\nmust be done in a try..catch statement:\\nwhile(true) {\\nint data = source.read();\\nif (data < 0)\\nbreak;\\ncopy.write(data);\\n}\\nThe ﬁle-copy command in an operating system such as UNIX uses command line argu-\\nments to specify the names of the ﬁles. F or example, the user m ight say “ copy original.dat\\nbackup.dat” to copy an existing ﬁle, original.dat, to a ﬁle named backup.dat. Command-\\nline arguments can also be used in Java programs. The command line arguments are stored in\\nthe array of strings, args, which is a parameter to the main() routine. The program can retrieve\\nthe command-line arguments from this array . (See Subsectio n 7.2.3.) F or example, if the pro-\\ngram is named CopyFile and if the user runs the program with the command “ java CopyFile\\nwork.dat oldwork.dat”, then in the program, args[0] will be the string \"work.dat\" and\\nargs[1] will be the string \"oldwork.dat\". The value of args.length tells the program how\\nmany command-line arguments were speciﬁed by the user.\\nMy CopyFile program gets the names of the ﬁles from the command-line argu ments. It\\nprints an error message and exits if the ﬁle names are not spec iﬁed. T o add a little interest,\\nthere are two ways to use the program. The command line can sim ply specify the two ﬁle names.\\nIn that case, if the output ﬁle already exists, the program wi ll print an error message and end.\\nThis is to make sure that the user won’t accidently overwrite an important ﬁle. However, if the\\ncommand line has three arguments, then the ﬁrst argument mus t be “ -f” while the second and\\nthird arguments are ﬁle names. The -f is a command-line option , which is meant to modify\\nthe behavior of the program. The program interprets the -f to mean that it’s OK to overwrite\\nan existing program. (The “f” stands for “force,” since it fo rces the ﬁle to be copied in spite of\\nwhat would otherwise have been considered an error.) Y ou can see in the source code how the\\ncommand line arguments are interpreted by the program:\\nimport java.io.*;\\n/**\\n* Makes a copy of a file. The original file and the name of the'),\n",

It wo uld make more sense to think of\\nthe phone book as a persistent collection of data, and to thin k of the program as an interface to\\nthat collection of data. The program would allow the user to l ook up names in the phone book\\nand to add new entries. Any changes that are made should be pre served after the program\\nends.\\nThe sample program PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java is a very simple implementation of this\\nidea. It is meant only as an example of ﬁle use; the phone book t hat it implements is a “toy”\\nversion that is not meant to taken seriously . This program st ores the phone book data in a ﬁle\\nnamed “ .phone book demo” in the user’s home directory . T o ﬁnd the user’s home directo ry ,\\nit uses the System.getProperty() method that was mentioned in Subsection 11.2.2. When\\nthe program starts, it checks whether the ﬁle already exists . If it does, it should contain the\\nuser’s phone book, which was saved in a previous run of the pro gram, so the data from the ﬁle\\nis read and entered into a T reeMap named phoneBook that represents the phone book while\\nthe program is running. (See Subsection 10.3.1.) In order to store the phone book in a ﬁle,\\nsome decision must be made about how the data in the phone book will be represented. F or\\nthis example, I chose a simple representation in which each l ine of the ﬁle contains one entry\\nconsisting of a name and the associated phone number. A perce nt sign ( ’%’) separates the\\nname from the number. The following code at the beginning of t he program will read the\\nphone book data ﬁle, if it exists and has the correct format:\\nFile userHomeDirectory = new File( System.getProperty(\"user.home\") );\\nFile dataFile = new File( userHomeDirectory, \".phone book data\" );\\nif ( ! dataFile.exists() ) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"No phone book data file found.\");\\nSystem.out.println(\"A new one will be created.\");\\nSystem.out.println(\"File name: \" + dataFile.getAbsolute Path());\\n}\\nelse {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Reading phone book data...\");\\ntry {\\nScanner scanner = new Scanner( dataFile );\\nwhile (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\\n// Read one line from the file, containing one name/number pair.\\nString phoneEntry = scanner.nextLine();\\nint separatorPosition = phoneEntry.indexOf(’%’);\\nif (separatorPosition == -1)\\nthrow new IOException(\"File is not a phonebook data file.\");\\nname = phoneEntry.substring(0, separatorPosition);\\nnumber = phoneEntry.substring(separatorPosition+1);\\nphoneBook.put(name,number);\\n}\\n}\\ncatch (IOException e) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Error in phone book data file.\");\\nSystem.out.println(\"File name: \" + dataFile.getAbsolute Path());\\nSystem.out.println(\"This program cannot continue.\");\\nSystem.exit(1);\\n}\\n}'),\n",

Programs typically have an “Open” command that reads\\nthe data from a ﬁle and displays it in a window and a “Save” comm and that writes the data\\nfrom the window into a ﬁle. W e can illustrate this in Java with a simple text editor program,\\nTrivialEdit.java. The window for this program uses a JT extArea component to display some\\ntext that the user can edit. It also has a menu bar, with a “File ” menu that includes “Open”\\nand “Save” commands. These commands are implemented using t he techniques for reading and\\nwriting ﬁles that were covered in Section 11.2.\\nWhen the user selects the Open command from the File menu in th e TrivialEdit program,\\nthe program pops up a ﬁle dialog box where the user speciﬁes th e ﬁle. It is assumed that the\\nﬁle is a text ﬁle. A limit of 10000 characters is put on the size of the ﬁle, since a JT extArea\\nis not meant for editing large amounts of text. The program re ads the text contained in the\\nspeciﬁed ﬁle, and sets that text to be the content of the JT extArea. In this case, I decided to\\nuse a BuﬀeredReader to read the ﬁle line-by-line. The program also sets the title bar of the\\nwindow to show the name of the ﬁle that was opened. All this is d one in the following method,\\nwhich is just a variation of the readFile() method presented in Section 11.2:\\n/**\\n* Carry out the Open command by letting the user specify a file to be opened\\n* and reading up to 10000 characters from that file.

PROGRAMMING WITH FILES 561\\n11.3.4 Storing Objects in Files\\nWhenever data is stored in ﬁles, some deﬁnite format must be a dopted for representing the\\ndata. As long as the output routine that writes the data and th e input routine that reads the\\ndata use the same format, the ﬁles will be usable. However, as usual, correctness is not the\\nend of the story . The representation that is used for data in ﬁ les should also be robust. (See\\nSection 8.1) T o see what this means, we will look at several di ﬀerent ways of representing the\\nsame data. This example builds on the example SimplePaint2.java from Subsection 7.3.4. In\\nthat program, the user could use the mouse to draw simple sket ches. Now, we will add ﬁle\\ninput/output capabilities to that program. This will allow the user to save a sketch to a ﬁle\\nand later read the sketch back from the ﬁle into the program so that the user can continue to\\nwork on the sketch. The basic requirement is that all relevan t data about the sketch must be\\nsaved in the ﬁle, so that the sketch can be exactly restored wh en the ﬁle is read by the program.\\nThe new version of the program can be found in the source code ﬁ le SimplePaintWith-\\nFiles.java. A “File” menu has been added to the new version. It contains t wo sets of Save/Open\\ncommands, one for saving and reloading sketch data in text fo rm and one for data in binary\\nform. W e will consider both possibilities here, in some deta il.\\nThe data for a sketch consists of the background color of the p icture and a list of the curves\\nthat were drawn by the user. A curve consists of a list of Points. ( Point is a standard class\\nin package java.awt; a Point pt has instance variables x and y of type int that represent the\\ncoordinates of a point on the xy-plane.) Each curve can be a di ﬀerent color. F urthermore, a\\ncurve can be “symmetric,” which means that in addition to the curve itself, the horizontal and\\nvertical reﬂections of the curve are also drawn.) The data fo r each curve is stored in an object\\nof type CurveData, which is deﬁned in the program as:\\n/**\\n* An object of type CurveData represents the data required to redraw one\\n* of the curves that have been sketched by the user.\\n*/\\nprivate static class CurveData implements Serializable {\\nColor color; // The color of the curve.\\nboolean symmetric; // Are horizontal and vertical reflecti ons also drawn?\\nArrayList<Point> points; // The points on the curve.\\n}\\nNote that this class has been declared to “ implement Serializable”. This allows objects of\\ntype CurveData to be written in binary form to an ObjectOutputStream. See Subsection 11.1.6.\\nLet’s think about how the data for a sketch could be saved to an ObjectOuputStream. The\\nsketch is displayed on the screen in an object of type SimplePaintPanel, which is a subclass of\\nJPanel. All the data needed for the sketch is stored in instance vari ables of that object. One\\npossibility would be to simply write the entire SimplePaintPanel component as a single object\\nto the stream. The could be done in a method in the SimplePaintPanel class with the statement\\noutputStream.writeObject(this);\\nwhere outputStream is the ObjectOutputStream and “ this” refers to the SimplePaintPanel\\nitself. This statement saves the entire current state of the panel. T o read the data back into\\nthe program, you would create an ObjectInputStream for reading the object from the ﬁle, and\\nyou would retrieve the object from the ﬁle with the statement\\nSimplePaintPanel newPanel = (SimplePaintPanel)in.readObject();'),\n",

FILES AND NETWORKING\\nwhere in is the ObjectInputStream. Note that the type-cast is necessary because the method\\nin.readObject() returns a value of type Object. (T o get the saved sketch to appear on the\\nscreen, the newPanel must replace the current content pane in the program’s windo w; further-\\nmore, the menu bar of the window must be replaced, because the menus are associated with a\\nparticular SimplePaintPanel object.)\\nIt might look tempting to be able to save data and restore it wi th a single command, but\\nin this case, it’s not a good idea. The main problem with doing things this way is that the\\nserialized form of objects that represent Swing components can change from one\\nversion of Java to the next. This means that data ﬁles that con tain serialized components such\\nas a SimplePaintPanel might become unusable in the future, and the data that they co ntain will\\nbe eﬀectively lost. This is an important consideration for a ny serious application.\\nT aking this into consideration, my program uses a diﬀerent f ormat when it creates a binary\\nﬁle. The data written to the ﬁle consists of (1) the backgroun d color of the sketch, (2) the\\nnumber of curves in the sketch, and (3) all the CurveData objects that describe the individual\\ncurves. The method that saves the data is similar to the writeFile() method from Subsec-\\ntion 11.2.3. Here is the complete doSaveAsBinary() from SimplePaintWithFiles, with the\\nchanges from the generic readFile() method shown in italic:\\n/**\\n* Save the user’s sketch to a file in binary form as serialized\\n* objects, using an ObjectOutputStream.

FILES AND NETWORKING\\nAn alternative to using object streams is to save the data in h uman-readable, character\\nform. The basic idea is the same: All the data necessary to rec onstitute a sketch must be saved\\nto the output ﬁle in some deﬁnite format. The method that read s the ﬁle must follow exactly\\nthe same format as it reads the data, and it must use the data to rebuild the data structures\\nthat represent the sketch while the program is running.\\nWhen writing character data, we can’t write out entire objec ts in one step. All the data has\\nto be expressed, ultimately , in terms of simple data values s uch as strings and primitive type\\nvalues. A color, for example, can be expressed in terms of thr ee integers giving the red, green,\\nand blue components of the color. The ﬁrst (not very good) ide a that comes to mind might be\\nto just dump all the necessary data, in some deﬁnite order, in to the ﬁle. Suppose that out is a\\nPrintWriter that is used to write to the ﬁle. W e could then say:\\nColor bgColor = getBackground(); // Write the background co lor to the file.\\nout.println( bgColor.getRed() );\\nout.println( bgColor.getGreen() );\\nout.println( bgColor.getBlue() );\\nout.println( curves.size() ); // Write the number of curves .\\nfor ( CurveData curve : curves ) { // For each curve, write...\\nout.println( curve.color.getRed() ); // the color of the cu rve\\nout.println( curve.color.getGreen() );\\nout.println( curve.color.getBlue() );\\nout.println( curve.symmetric ? 0 : 1 ); // the curve’s symmet ry property\\nout.println( curve.points.size() ); // the number of point s on curve\\nfor ( Point pt : curve.points ) { // the coordinates of each poi nt\\nout.println( pt.x );\\nout.println( pt.y );\\n}\\n}\\nThis works in the sense that the ﬁle-reading method can read t he data and rebuild the data\\nstructures. Suppose that the input method uses a Scanner named scanner to read the data ﬁle\\n(see Subsection 11.1.5). Then it could say:\\nColor newBackgroundColor; // Read the background Color.\\nint red = scanner.nextInt();\\nint green = scanner.nextInt();\\nint blue = scanner.nextInt();\\nnewBackgroundColor = new Color(red,green,blue);\\nArrayList<CurveData> newCurves = new ArrayList<CurveData>();\\nint curveCount = scanner.nextInt(); // The number of curves to be read.\\nfor (int i = 0; i < curveCount; i++) {\\nCurveData curve = new CurveData();\\nint r = scanner.nextInt(); // Read the curve’s color.\\nint g = scanner.nextInt();\\nint b = scanner.nextInt();\\ncurve.color = new Color(r,g,b);\\nint symmetryCode = scanner.nextInt(); // Read the curve’s symmetry property.\\ncurve.symmetric = (symmetryCode == 1);\\ncurveData.points = new ArrayList<Point>();\\nint pointCount = scanner.nextInt(); // The number of points on this curve.\\nfor (int j = 0; j < pointCount; j++) {'),\n",

While this does work, the data ﬁle is just a long string of numbers. It\\ndoesn’t make much more sense to a human reader than a binary-f ormat ﬁle would. F urthermore,\\nit is still fragile in the sense that any small change made to t he data representation in the\\nprogram, such as adding a new property to curves, will render the data ﬁle useless (unless you\\nhappen to remember exactly which version of the program crea ted the ﬁle).\\nSo, I decided to use a more complex, more meaningful data form at for the text ﬁles created\\nby my program. Instead of just writing numbers, I add words to say what the numbers mean.\\nHere is a short but complete data ﬁle for the program; just by l ooking at it, you can probably\\ntell what is going on:\\nSimplePaintWithFiles 1.0\\nbackground 110 110 180\\nstartcurve\\ncolor 255 255 255\\nsymmetry true\\ncoords 10 10\\ncoords 200 250\\ncoords 300 10\\nendcurve\\nstartcurve\\ncolor 0 255 255\\nsymmetry false\\ncoords 10 400\\ncoords 590 400\\nendcurve\\nThe ﬁrst line of the ﬁle identiﬁes the program that created th e data ﬁle; when the user\\nselects a ﬁle to be opened, the program can check the ﬁrst word in the ﬁle as a simple test to\\nmake sure the the ﬁle is of the correct type. The ﬁrst line also contains a version number, 1.0.\\nIf the ﬁle format changes in a later version of the program, a h igher version number would be\\nused; if the program sees a version number of 1.2 in a ﬁle, but t he program only understands\\nversion 1.0, the program can explain to the user that a newer v ersion of the program is needed\\nto read the data ﬁle.\\nThe second line of the ﬁle speciﬁes the background color of th e picture. The three integers\\nspecify the red, green, and blue components of the color. The word “background” at the\\nbeginning of the line makes the meaning clear. The remainder of the ﬁle consists of data for the\\ncurves that appear in the picture. The data for each curve is c learly marked with “startcurve”\\nand “endcurve.” The data consists of the color and symmetry p roperties of the curve and the\\nxy-coordinates of each point on the curve. Again, the meanin g is clear. Files in this format can\\neasily be created or edited by hand. In fact, the data ﬁle show n above was actually created in'),\n",

F uture versions of the program coul d add a “thickness” property to the\\ncurves to make it possible to have curves that are more than on e pixel wide. Shapes such as\\nrectangles and ovals could easily be added.\\nOutputting data in this format is easy . Suppose that out is a PrintWriter that is being used\\nto write the sketch data to a ﬁle. Then the output can be done wi th:\\nout.println(\"SimplePaintWithFiles 1.0\"); // Version number.\\nColor bgColor = getBackground();\\nout.println( \"background \" + bgColor.getRed() + \" \" +\\nbgColor.getGreen() + \" \" + bgColor.getBlue() );\\nfor ( CurveData curve : curves ) {\\nout.println();\\nout.println(\"startcurve\");\\nout.println(\" color \" + curve.color.getRed() + \" \" +\\ncurve.color.getGreen() + \" \" + curve.color.getBlue() );\\nout.println( \" symmetry \" + curve.symmetric );\\nfor ( Point pt : curve.points )\\nout.println( \" coords \" + pt.x + \" \" + pt.y );\\nout.println(\"endcurve\");\\n}\\nReading the data is somewhat harder, since the input routine has to deal with all the extra\\nwords in the data. In my input routine, I decided to allow some variation in the order in which\\nthe data occurs in the ﬁle. F or example, the background color can be speciﬁed at the end of\\nthe ﬁle, instead of at the beginning.

In Section 11.6,\\nwe will look at one solution to the data representation probl em that has become increasingly\\ncommon.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nIn addition to being able to save sketch data in both text form and binary form,\\nSimplePaintWithFiles can also save the picture itself as an image ﬁle that could be, for\\nexample, printed or put on a web page. This is a preview of imag e-handling techniques that\\nwill be covered in Chapter 12.\\n11.4 Networking\\nAs far as a program is concerned, a network is just another possible source of input data,\\nand another place where data can be output. That does oversim plify things, because networks\\nare not as easy to work with as ﬁles are. But in Java, you can do n etwork communication using\\ninput streams and output streams, just as you can use such str eams to communicate with the\\nuser or to work with ﬁles. Nevertheless, opening a network co nnection between two computers\\nis a bit tricky , since there are two computers involved and th ey have to somehow agree to open a\\nconnection. And when each computer can send data to the other , synchronizing communication\\ncan be a problem. But the fundamentals are the same as for othe r forms of I/O.\\nOne of the standard Java packages is called java.net. This package includes several\\nclasses that can be used for networking. Two diﬀerent styles of network I/O are supported.\\nOne of these, which is fairly high-level, is based on the W orl d-Wide W eb, and provides the\\nsort of network communication capability that is used by a W e b browser when it downloads\\npages for you to view. The main classes for this style of netwo rking are java.net.URL and\\njava.net.URLConnection. An object of type URL is an abstract representation of a Univer-\\nsal Resource Locator , which is an address for an HTML document or other resource on the\\nW eb. A URLConnection represents a network connection to such a resource.\\nThe second style of I/O, which is more general and much more im portant, views the network\\nat a lower level. It is based on the idea of a socket. A socket is used by a program to establish\\na connection with another program on a network. Communicati on over a network involves two\\nsockets, one on each of the computers involved in the communi cation. Java uses a class called\\njava.net.Socket to represent sockets that are used for network communicatio n. The term\\n“socket” presumably comes from an image of physically plugg ing a wire into a computer to\\nestablish a connection to a network, but it is important to un derstand that a socket, as the\\nterm is used here, is simply an object belonging to the class Socket. In particular, a program\\ncan have several sockets at the same time, each connecting it to another program running on\\nsome other computer on the network. All these connections us e the same physical network\\nconnection.'),\n",

NETWORKING 569\\nThis section gives a brief introduction to these basic netwo rking classes, and shows how\\nthey relate to input and output streams.\\n11.4.1 URLs and URLConnections\\nThe URL class is used to represent resources on the W orld-Wide W eb. E very resource has an\\naddress, which identiﬁes it uniquely and contains enough in formation for a W eb browser to ﬁnd\\nthe resource on the network and retrieve it. The address is ca lled a “url” or “universal resource\\nlocator.”\\nAn object belonging to the URL class represents such an address. Once you have a URL\\nobject, you can use it to open a URLConnection to the resource at that address. A url is\\nordinarily speciﬁed as a string, such as “ http://math.hws.edu/eck/index.html”. There are\\nalso relative url’s . A relative url speciﬁes the location of a resource relative to the location of\\nanother url, which is called the base or context for the relative url. F or example, if the context\\nis given by the url http://math.hws.edu/eck/, then the incomplete, relative url “ index.html”\\nwould really refer to http://math.hws.edu/eck/index.html.\\nAn object of the class URL is not simply a string, but it can be constructed from a string\\nrepresentation of a url. A URL object can also be constructed from another URL object, repre-\\nsenting a context, and a string that speciﬁes a url relative t o that context. These constructors\\nhave prototypes\\npublic URL(String urlName) throws MalformedURLException\\nand\\npublic URL(URL context, String relativeName) throws MalformedURLException\\nNote that these constructors will throw an exception of type MalformedURLException if the\\nspeciﬁed strings don’t represent legal url’s. The MalformedURLException class is a subclass\\nof IOException, and it requires mandatory exception handling. That is, you must call the\\nconstructor inside a try..catch statement that handles the exception or in a subroutine that\\nis declared to throw the exception.\\nThe second constructor is especially convenient when writi ng applets. In an applet, two\\nmethods are available that provide useful URL contexts. The method getDocumentBase(),\\ndeﬁned in the Applet and JApplet classes, returns an object of type URL. This URL represents\\nthe location from which the HTML page that contains the apple t was downloaded. This allows\\nthe applet to go back and retrieve other ﬁles that are stored i n the same location as that\\ndocument. F or example,\\nURL url = new URL(getDocumentBase(), \"data.txt\");\\nconstructs a URL that refers to a ﬁle named data.txt on the same computer and in the same\\ndirectory as the source ﬁle for the web page on which the apple t is running. Another method,\\ngetCodeBase(), returns a URL that gives the location of the applet class ﬁle (which is not\\nnecessarily the same as the location of the document).\\nOnce you have a valid URL object, you can call its openConnection() method to set up a\\nconnection. This method returns a URLConnection. The URLConnection object can, in turn,\\nbe used to create an InputStream for reading data from the resource represented by the URL.\\nThis is done by calling its getInputStream() method. F or example:\\nURL url = new URL(urlAddressString);\\nURLConnection connection = url.openConnection();\\nInputStream in = connection.getInputStream();'),\n",

FILES AND NETWORKING\\nThe openConnection() and getInputStream() methods can both throw exceptions of type\\nIOException. Once the InputStream has been created, you can read from it in the usual way ,\\nincluding wrapping it in another input steam type, such as T extReader, or using a Scanner.\\nReading from the stream can, of course, generate exceptions .\\nOne of the other useful instance methods in the URLConnection class is getContentType(),\\nwhich returns a String that describes the type of information available from the UR L. The\\nreturn value can be null if the type of information is not yet known or if it is not possi -\\nble to determine the type. The type might not be available unt il after the input stream has\\nbeen created, so you should generally call getContentType() after getInputStream(). The\\nstring returned by getContentType() is in a format called a mime type . Mime types include\\n“text/plain”, “text/html”, “image/jpeg”, “image/gif”, a nd many others. All mime types con-\\ntain two parts: a general type, such as “text” or “image”, and a more speciﬁc type within that\\ngeneral category , such as “html” or “gif”. If you are only int erested in text data, for example,\\nyou can check whether the string returned by getContentType() starts with “text”. (Mime\\ntypes were ﬁrst introduced to describe the content of email m essages. The name stands for\\n“Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.” They are now used almost universally to specify the\\ntype of information in a ﬁle or other resource.)\\nLet’s look at a short example that uses all this to read the dat a from a URL. This subroutine\\nopens a connection to a speciﬁed URL, checks that the type of d ata at the URL is text, and\\nthen copies the text onto the screen. Many of the operations i n this subroutine can throw\\nexceptions. They are handled by declaring that the subrouti ne “ throws IOException” and\\nleaving it up to the main program to decide what to do when an er ror occurs.\\nstatic void readTextFromURL( String urlString ) throws IOException {\\n/* Open a connection to the URL, and get an input stream\\nfor reading data from the URL. */\\nURL url = new URL(urlString);\\nURLConnection connection = url.openConnection();\\nInputStream urlData = connection.getInputStream();\\n/* Check that the content is some type of text. */\\nString contentType = connection.getContentType();\\nif (contentType == null || contentType.startsWith(\"text\") == false)\\nthrow new IOException(\"URL does not seem to refer to a text file.\");\\n/* Copy lines of text from the input stream to the screen, until\\nend-of-file is encountered (or an error occurs). */\\nBufferedReader in; // For reading from the connection’s inp ut stream.\\nin = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader(urlData) );\\nwhile (true) {\\nString line = in.readLine();\\nif (line == null)\\nbreak;\\nSystem.out.println(line);\\n}\\n} // end readTextFromURL()\\nA complete program that uses this subroutine can be found in t he ﬁle ReadURL.java. When\\nusing the program, note that you have to specify a complete ur l, including the “ http://” at'),\n",

NETWORKING 571\\nthe beginning. There is also an applet version of the program , which you can ﬁnd in the on-line\\nversion of this section.\\n11.4.2 TCP/IP and Client/Server\\nCommunication over the Internet is based on a pair of protoco ls called the Transmission\\nControl Protocol and the Internet Protocol , which are collectively referred to as TCP/IP .\\n(In fact, there is a more basic communication protocol calle d UDP that can be used instead of\\nTCP in certain applications. UDP is supported in Java, but fo r this discussion, I’ll stick to the\\nfull TCP/IP , which provides reliable two-way communicatio n between networked computers.)\\nF or two programs to communicate using TCP/IP , each program m ust create a socket, as\\ndiscussed earlier in this section, and those sockets must be connected. Once such a connection\\nis made, communication takes place using input streams and o utput streams. Each program\\nhas its own input stream and its own output stream. Data writt en by one program to its output\\nstream is transmitted to the other computer. There, it enter s the input stream of the program\\nat the other end of the network connection. When that program reads data from its input\\nstream, it is receiving the data that was transmitted to it ov er the network.\\nThe hard part, then, is making a network connection in the ﬁrs t place. Two sockets are\\ninvolved. T o get things started, one program must create a so cket that will wait passively until\\na connection request comes in from another socket. The waiti ng socket is said to be listening\\nfor a connection. On the other side of the connection-to-be, another program creates a socket\\nthat sends out a connection request to the listening socket. When the listening socket receives\\nthe connection request, it responds, and the connection is e stablished. Once that is done, each\\nprogram can obtain an input stream and an output stream for se nding data over the connection.\\nCommunication takes place through these streams until one p rogram or the other closes the\\nconnection.\\nA program that creates a listening socket is sometimes said t o be a server, and the socket is\\ncalled a server socket . A program that connects to a server is called a client, and the socket\\nthat it uses to make a connection is called a client socket . The idea is that the server is out\\nthere somewhere on the network, waiting for a connection req uest from some client. The server\\ncan be thought of as oﬀering some kind of service, and the clie nt gets access to that service by\\nconnecting to the server. This is called the client/server model of network communication.\\nIn many actual applications, a server program can provide co nnections to several clients at the\\nsame time. When a client connects to a server’s listening soc ket, that socket does not stop\\nlistening. Instead, it continues listening for additional client connections at the same time that\\nthe ﬁrst client is being serviced. T o do this, it is necessary to use threads (Section 8.5). W e’ll\\nlook at how it works in the next section.\\nThe URL class that was discussed at the beginning of this section use s a client socket behind\\nthe scenes to do any necessary network communication. On the other side of that connection is\\na server program that accepts a connection request from the URL object, reads a request from\\nthat object for some particular ﬁle on the server computer, a nd responds by transmitting the\\ncontents of that ﬁle over the network back to the URL object. After transmitting the data, the\\nserver closes the connection.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nA client program has to have some way to specify which compute r, among all those on the\\nnetwork, it wants to communicate with. Every computer on the Internet has an IP address\\nwhich identiﬁes it uniquely among all the computers on the ne t. Many computers can also'),\n",

FILES AND NETWORKING\\nbe referred to by domain names such as math.hws.edu or www.whitehouse.gov. (See Sec-\\ntion 1.7.) T raditional (or IPv4 ) IP addresses are 32-bit integers. They are usually written in\\nthe so-called “dotted decimal” form, such as 69.9.161.200, where each of the four numbers\\nin the address represents an 8-bit integer in the range 0 thro ugh 255. A new version of the\\nInternet Protocol, IPv6 , is currently being introduced. IPv6 addresses are 128-bit integers and\\nare usually written in hexadecimal form (with some colons an d maybe some extra information\\nthrown in). In actual use, IPv6 addresses are still farily ra re.\\nA computer can have several IP addresses, and can have both IP v4 and IPv6 addresses.\\nUsually , one of these is the loopback address , which can be used when a program wants to\\ncommunicate with another program on the same computer . The loopback address has IPv4\\naddress 127.0.0.1 and can also, in general, be referred to us ing the domain name localhost. In\\naddition, there can be one or more IP addresses associated wi th physical network connections.\\nY our computer probably has some utility for displaying your computer’s IP addresses. I have\\nwritten a small Java program, ShowMyNetwork.java, that does the same thing. When I run\\nShowMyNetwork on my computer, the output is:\\nen1 : /192.168.1.47 /fe80:0:0:0:211:24ff:fe9c:5271%5\\nlo0 : /127.0.0.1 /fe80:0:0:0:0:0:0:1%1 /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 %0\\nThe ﬁrst thing on each line is a network interface name, which is really meaningful only to the\\ncomputer’s operating system. The output also contains the I P addresses for that interface. In\\nthis example, lo0 refers to the loopback address, which has IPv4 address 127.0 .0.1 as usual.\\nThe most important number here is 192.168.1.47, which is the IPv4 address that can be used\\nfor communication over the network.\\nNow, a single computer might have several programs doing net work communication at the\\nsame time, or one program communicating with several other c omputers. T o allow for this\\npossibility , a network connection is actually identiﬁed by a port number in combination with\\nan IP address. A port number is just a 16-bit integer. A server does not simply listen for\\nconnections—it listens for connections on a particular port . A potential client must know both\\nthe Internet address (or domain name) of the computer on whic h the server is running and\\nthe port number on which the server is listening. A W eb server , for example, generally listens\\nfor connections on port 80; other standard Internet service s also have standard port numbers.\\n(The standard port numbers are all less than 1024, and are res erved for particular services. If\\nyou create your own server programs, you should use port numb ers greater than 1024.)\\n11.4.3 Sockets\\nT o implement TCP/IP connections, the java.net package provides two classes, ServerSocket\\nand Socket. A ServerSocket represents a listening socket that waits for connection req uests\\nfrom clients. A Socket represents one endpoint of an actual network connection. A Socket\\ncan be a client socket that sends a connection request to a ser ver. But a Socket can also be\\ncreated by a server to handle a connection request from a clie nt. This allows the server to create\\nmultiple sockets and handle multiple connections. A ServerSocket does not itself participate\\nin connections; it just listens for connection requests and creates Sockets to handle the actual\\nconnections.\\nWhen you construct a ServerSocket object, you have to specify the port number on which\\nthe server will listen. The speciﬁcation for the constructo r is\\npublic ServerSocket(int port) throws IOException'),\n",

NETWORKING 573\\nThe port number must be in the range 0 through 65535, and shoul d generally be greater than\\n1024. (A value of 0 tells the server socket to listen on any ava ilable port.) The constructor\\nmight throw a SecurityException if a smaller port number is speciﬁed. An IOException can occur\\nif, for example, the speciﬁed port number is already in use.\\nAs soon as a ServerSocket is created, it starts listening for connection requests. Th e\\naccept() method in the ServerSocket class accepts such a request, establishes a connection\\nwith the client, and returns a Socket that can be used for communication with the client. The\\naccept() method has the form\\npublic Socket accept() throws IOException\\nWhen you call the accept() method, it will not return until a connection request is rece ived (or\\nuntil some error occurs). The method is said to block while waiting for the connection. (While\\nthe method is blocked, the thread that called the method can’ t do anything else. However,\\nother threads in the same program can proceed.) Y ou can call accept() repeatedly to accept\\nmultiple connection requests. The ServerSocket will continue listening for connections until it is\\nclosed, using its close() method, or until some error occurs, or until the program is te rminated\\nin some way .\\nSuppose that you want a server to listen on port 1728, and supp ose that you’ve written\\na method provideService(Socket) to handle the communication with one client. Then the\\nbasic form of the server program would be:\\ntry {\\nServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(1728);\\nwhile (true) {\\nSocket connection = server.accept();\\nprovideService(connection);\\n}\\n}\\ncatch (IOException e) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Server shut down with error: \" + e);\\n}\\nOn the client side, a client socket is created using a constru ctor in the Socket class. T o\\nconnect to a server on a known computer and port, you would use the constructor\\npublic Socket(String computer, int port) throws IOException\\nThe ﬁrst parameter can be either an IP number or a domain name. This constructor will block\\nuntil the connection is established or until an error occurs .\\nOnce you have a connected socket, no matter how it was created , you can use the Socket\\nmethods getInputStream() and getOutputStream() to obtain streams that can be used for\\ncommunication over the connection. These methods return ob jects of type InputStream and\\nOutputStream, respectively . Keeping all this in mind, here is the outline of a method for\\nworking with a client connection:\\n/**\\n* Open a client connection to a specified server computer and\\n* port number on the server, and then do communication through\\n* the connection.\\n*/\\nvoid doClientConnection(String computerName, int serverPort) {\\nSocket connection;\\nInputStream in;'),\n",

(And if you think it\\nsounded hard, then it’s even harder.) If networks were compl etely reliable, things would be\\nalmost as easy as I’ve described. The problem, though, is to w rite robust programs that can deal\\nwith network and human error. I won’t go into detail here. How ever, what I’ve covered here\\nshould give you the basic ideas of network programming, and i t is enough to write some simple\\nnetwork applications. Let’s look at a few working examples o f client/server programming.\\n11.4.4 A T rivial Client/Server\\nThe ﬁrst example consists of two programs. The source code ﬁl es for the programs are Date-\\nClient.java and DateServer.java. One is a simple network client and the other is a matching\\nserver. The client makes a connection to the server, reads on e line of text from the server, and\\ndisplays that text on the screen. The text sent by the server c onsists of the current date and\\ntime on the computer where the server is running. In order to o pen a connection, the client\\nmust know the computer on which the server is running and the p ort on which it is listening.\\nThe server listens on port number 32007. The port number coul d be anything between 1025\\nand 65535, as long the server and the client use the same port. Port numbers between 1 and\\n1024 are reserved for standard services and should not be use d for other servers. The name or\\nIP number of the computer on which the server is running must b e speciﬁed as a command-line\\nargument F or example, if the server is running on a computer n amed math.hws.edu, then you\\nwould typically run the client with the command “ java DateClient math.hws.edu”. Here is\\nthe complete client program:\\nimport java.net.*;\\nimport java.io.*;\\n/**\\n* This program opens a connection to a computer specified\\n* as the first command-line argument.

FILES AND NETWORKING\\nIn order for this program to run without error, the server pro gram must be running on\\nthe computer to which the client tries to connect. By the way , it’s possible to run the client\\nand the server program on the same computer. F or example, you can open two command\\nwindows, start the server in one window and then run the clien t in the other window. T o make\\nthings like this easier, most computers will recognize the d omain name localhost and the\\nIP number 127.0.0.1 as referring to “this computer.” This means that the command “ java\\nDateClient localhost” will tell the DateClient program to connect to a server running on the\\nsame computer. If that command doesn’t work, try “ java DateClient 127.0.0.1”.\\nThe server program that corresponds to the DateClient client program is called DateServer.\\nThe DateServer program creates a ServerSocket to listen for connection requests on port 32007.\\nAfter the listening socket is created, the server will enter an inﬁnite loop in which it accepts\\nand processes connections. This will continue until the pro gram is killed in some way—for\\nexample by typing a CONTROL-C in the command window where the server is running. When a\\nconnection is received from a client, the server calls a subr outine to handle the connection. In\\nthe subroutine, any Exception that occurs is caught, so that it will not crash the server. Ju st\\nbecause a connection to one client has failed for some reason , it does not mean that the server\\nshould be shut down; the error might have been the fault of the client. The connection-handling\\nsubroutine creates a PrintWriter for sending data over the connection. It writes the current d ate\\nand time to this stream and then closes the connection. (The s tandard class java.util.Date\\nis used to obtain the current time. An object of type Date represents a particular date and\\ntime.

If you fail t o ﬂush your output streams, it is\\npossible that your network application will work on some typ es of computers but not on others.\\n11.4.5 A Simple Network Chat\\nIn the DateServer example, the server transmits information and the client re ads it. It’s also\\npossible to have two-way communication between client and s erver. As a ﬁrst example, we’ll\\nlook at a client and server that allow a user on each end of the c onnection to send messages\\nto the other user. The program works in a command-line interf ace where the users type in\\ntheir messages. In this example, the server waits for a conne ction from a single client and then\\ncloses down its listener so that no other clients can connect . After the client and server are\\nconnected, both ends of the connection work in much the same w ay . The user on the client end\\ntypes a message, and it is transmitted to the server, which di splays it to the user on that end.\\nThen the user of the server types a message that is transmitte d to the client. Then the client\\nuser types another message, and so on. This continues until o ne user or the other enters “quit”\\nwhen prompted for a message. When that happens, the connecti on is closed and both programs\\nterminate. The client program and the server program are ver y similar. The techniques for\\nopening the connections diﬀer, and the client is programmed to send the ﬁrst message while\\nthe server is programmed to receive the ﬁrst message. The cli ent and server programs can be\\nfound in the ﬁles CLChatClient.java and CLChatServer.java. (The name “CLChat” stands for\\n“command-line chat.”) Here is the source code for the server :\\nimport java.net.*;\\nimport java.io.*;\\n/**\\n* This program is one end of a simple command-line interface chat program.\\n* It acts as a server which waits for a connection from the CLChatClient\\n* program. The port on which the server listens can be specifi ed as a\\n* command-line argument. If it is not, then the port specifie d by the\\n* constant DEFAULT\\nPORT is used. Note that if a port number of zero is\\n* specified, then the server will listen on any available port.\\n* This program only supports one connection. As soon as a conn ection is\\n* opened, the listening socket is closed down. The two ends of the connection\\n* each send a HANDSHAKE string to the other, so that both ends can verify\\n* that the program on the other end is of the right type. Then th e connected\\n* programs alternate sending messages to each other. The cli ent always sends\\n* the first message. The user on either end can close the conne ction by\\n* entering the string \"quit\" when prompted for a message. Not e that the first\\n* character of any string sent over the connection must be 0 or 1; this\\n* character is interpreted as a command.\\n*/\\npublic class CLChatServer {\\n/**'),\n",

F or one thing, it uses a handshake to\\nmake sure that a client who is trying to connect is really a CLChatClient program. A handshake\\nis simply information sent between client and server as part of setting up the connection, before\\nany actual data is sent. In this case, each side of the connect ion sends a string to the other side\\nto identify itself. The handshake is part of the protocol that I made up for communication\\nbetween CLChatClient and CLChatServer. A protocol is a detailed speciﬁcation of what data\\nand messages can be exchanged over a connection, how they mus t be represented, and what\\norder they can be sent in. When you design a client/server app lication, the design of the\\nprotocol is an important consideration. Another aspect of t he CLChat protocol is that after the\\nhandshake, every line of text that is sent over the connectio n begins with a character that acts\\nas a command. If the character is 0, the rest of the line is a mes sage from one user to the other.\\nIf the character is 1, the line indicates that a user has enter ed the “quit” command, and the\\nconnection is to be shut down.\\nRemember that if you want to try out this program on a single co mputer, you can use\\ntwo command-line windows. In one, give the command “ java CLChatServer” to start the\\nserver. Then, in the other, use the command “ java CLChatClient localhost” to connect to\\nthe server that is running on the same machine.\\n11.5 Network Programming and Threads\\nIn the previous section, we looked at several examples of network programming. Those\\nexamples showed how to create network connections and commu nicate through them, but they\\ndidn’t deal with one of the fundamental characteristics of n etwork programming, the fact that\\nnetwork communication is fundamentally asynchronous. F ro m the point of view of a program\\non one end of a network connection, messages can arrive from t he other side of the connection at\\nany time; the arrival of a message is an event that is not under the control of the program that\\nis receiving the message. Certainly , it is possible to desig n a network communication protocol\\nthat proceeds in a synchronous, step-by-step process from b eginning to end—but whenever the\\nprocess gets to a point in the protocol where it needs to read a message from the other side of\\nthe connection, it has to wait for that message to arrive. Essentially , the process has to w ait'),\n",

FILES AND NETWORKING\\nfor a message-arrival event to occur before it can proceed. W hile it is waiting for the message,\\nwe say that the process is blocked.\\nPerhaps an event-oriented networking API would be a good app roach to dealing with the\\nasynchronous nature of network communication, but that is n ot the approach that is taken\\nin Java (or, typically , in other languages). Instead, a seri ous network program in Java uses\\nthreads. Threads were introduced in Section 8.5. A thread is a separa te computational\\nprocess that can run in parallel with other threads. When a pr ogram uses threads to do\\nnetwork communication, it is possible that some threads wil l be blocked, waiting for incoming\\nmessages, but other threads will still be able to continue pe rforming useful work.\\n11.5.1 A Threaded GUI Chat Program.\\nThe command-line chat programs, CLChatClient.java and CLChatServer.java, from the previ-\\nous section use a straight-through, step-by-step protocol for communication. After a user on\\none side of a connection enters a message, the user must wait f or a reply from the other side of\\nthe connection. An asynchronous chat program would be much n icer. In such a program, a user\\ncould just keep typing lines and sending messages without wa iting for any response. Messages\\nthat arrive—asynchronously—from the other side would be di splayed as soon as they arrive.\\nIt’s not easy to do this in a command-line interface, but it’s a natural application for a graphical\\nuser interface. The basic ides for a GUI chat program is to cre ate a thread whose job is to read\\nmessages that arrive from the other side of the connection. A s soon as the message arrives, it is\\ndisplayed to the user; then, the message-reading thread blo cks until the next incoming message\\narrives. While it is blocked, however, other threads can con tinue to run. In particular, the\\nGUI event-handling thread that responds to user actions kee ps running; that thread can send\\noutgoing messages as soon as the user generates them.\\nThe sample program GUIChat.java is an example of this. GUIChat is a two-way network\\nchat program that allows two users to send messages to each ot her over the network. In this\\nchat program, each user can send messages at any time, and inc oming messages are displayed\\nas soon as they are received.\\nThe GUIChat program can act as both the client end and the server end of a co nnection.\\nWhen GUIChat is started, a window appears on the screen. This window has a “ Listen” button\\nthat the user can click to create a server socket that will lis ten for an incoming connection\\nrequest; this makes the program act as a server. It also has a “ Connect” button that the the\\nuser can click to send a connection request; this makes the pr ogram act as a client. As usual,\\nthe server listens on a speciﬁed port number. The client need s to know the computer on which\\nthe server is running and the port on which the server is liste ning. There are input boxes in\\nthe GUIChat window where the user can enter this information. Once a conn ection has been\\nestablished between two GUIChat windows, each user can send messages to the other. The\\nwindow has an input box where the user types the message. Pres sing return while typing in\\nthis box sends the message. This means that the sending of the message is handled by the\\nusual event-handling thread, in response to an event genera ted by a user action. Messages\\nare received by a separate thread that just sits around waiti ng for incoming messages. This\\nthread blocks while waiting for a message to arrive; when a me ssage does arrive, it displays that\\nmessage to the user. The window contains a large transcript a rea that displays both incoming\\nand outgoing messages, along with other information about t he network connection.\\nI urge you to compile the source code, GUIChat.java, and try the program. T o make it easy\\nto try it on a single computer, you can make a connection betwe en one window and another\\nwindow on the same computer, using “localhost” or “127.0.0. 1” as the name of the computer.'),\n",

NETWORK PROGRAMMING AND THREADS 583\\n(Once you have one GUIChat window open, you can open a second one by clicking the “New”\\nbutton.) I also urge you to read the source code. I will discus s only parts of it here.\\nThe program uses a nested class, ConnectionHandler, to handle most network-related tasks.\\nConnectionHandler is a subclass of Thread. The ConnectionHandler thread is responsible for\\nopening the network connection and then for reading incomin g messages once the connection\\nhas been opened. (By putting the connection-opening code in a separate thread, we make\\nsure that the GUI is not blocked while the connection is being opened. Like reading incoming\\nmessages, opening a connection is a blocking operation that can take some time to complete.)\\nA ConnectionHandler is created when the user clicks the “Listen” or “Connect” but ton. The\\n“Listen” button should make the thread act as a server, while “Connect” should make it act\\nas a client. T o distinguish these two cases, the ConnectionHandler class has two constructors:\\n/**\\n* Listen for a connection on a specified port. The constructo r\\n* does not perform any network operations; it just sets some\\n* instance variables and starts the thread. Note that the\\n* thread will only listen for one connection, and then will\\n* close its server socket.\\n*/\\nConnectionHandler(int port) {\\nstate = ConnectionState.LISTENING;\\nthis.port = port;\\npostMessage(\"\\\\nLISTENING ON PORT \" + port + \"\\\\n\");\\nstart();\\n}\\n/**\\n* Open a connection to specified computer and port. The const ructor\\n* does not perform any network operations; it just sets some\\n* instance variables and starts the thread.\\n*/\\nConnectionHandler(String remoteHost, int port) {\\nstate = ConnectionState.CONNECTING;\\nthis.remoteHost = remoteHost;\\nthis.port = port;\\npostMessage(\"\\\\nCONNECTING TO \" + remoteHost + \" ON PORT \" + port + \"\\\\n\");\\nstart();\\n}\\nHere, state is an instance variable whose type is deﬁned by an enumerated type\\nenum ConnectionState { LISTENING, CONNECTING, CONNECTED, CLOSED };\\nThe values of this enum represent diﬀerent possible states of the network connecti on. It is often\\nuseful to treat a network connection as a state machine (see S ubsection 6.5.4), since the response\\nto various events can depend on the state of the connection wh en the event occurs. Setting the\\nstate variable to LISTENING or CONNECTING tells the thread whether it should act as a server\\nor as a client. Note that the postMessage() method posts a message to the transcript area of\\nthe window, where it will be visible to the user.\\nOnce the thread has been started, it executes the following run() method:\\n/**\\n* The run() method that is executed by the thread. It opens a\\n* connection as a client or as a server (depending on which'),\n",

It is importa nt to understand how the connection\\ncan be closed. The GUIChat window has a “Disconnect” button that the user can click to cl ose\\nthe connection. The program responds to this event by closin g the socket that represents the\\nconnection. It is likely that when this happens, the connect ion-handling thread is blocked in the\\nin.readLine() method, waiting for an incoming message. When the socket is c losed by another\\nthread, this method will fail and will throw an exception; th is exception causes the thread to\\nterminate. (If the connection-handling thread happens to b e between calls to in.readLine()\\nwhen the socket is closed, the while loop will terminate because the connection state changes'),\n",

It uses a PrintWriter, out, that writes to the socket’s output stream.

It would be nice if it were possible to discover, somehow, who’s\\nout there on the Internet waiting for a connection. Unfortun ately , this is not possible. And\\nyet, applications such as AOL Instant Messenger seem to do ju st that—they can show you a\\nlist of users who are available to receive messages. How can t hey do that?\\nI don’t know the details of instant messenger protocols, but it has to work something like\\nthis: When you start the client program, that program contac ts a server program that runs\\nconstantly on some particular computer and on some particul ar port. Since the server is always\\navailable at the same computer and port, the information nee ded to contact it can be built into\\nthe client program or otherwise made available to the users o f the program. The purpose of\\nthe server is to keep a list of available users. When your clie nt program contacts the server, it\\ngets a list of available users, along with whatever informat ion is necessary to send messages to\\nthose users. At the same time, your client program registers you with the server, so that the\\nserver can tell other users that you are on-line. When you shu t down the client program, you\\nare removed from the server’s list of users, and other users c an be informed that you have gone\\noﬀ-line.\\nOf course, in an application like AOL server, you only get to s ee a list of available users\\nfrom your “buddy list,” a list of your friends who are also AOL users. T o implement this, you\\nneed to have an account on the AOL server. The server needs to k eep a database of information\\nabout all user accounts, including the buddy list for each us er. This makes the server program\\nrather complicated, and I won’t consider that aspect of its f unctionality here. However, it is\\nnot very diﬃcult to write a scaled-down application that use s the network in a similar way . I\\ncall my scaled-down version “ BuddyChat.” It doesn’t keep separate buddy lists for each user; it\\nassumes that you’re willing to be buddies with anyone who hap pens to connect to the server. In\\nthis application, the server keeps a list of connected users and makes that list available to each\\nconnected user. A user can connect to another user and chat wi th that user, using a window\\nthat is very similar to the chat window in GUIChat. BuddyChat is still just a toy , compared to\\nserious network applications, but it does illustrate some c ore ideas.\\nThe BuddyChat application comes in several pieces. BuddyChatServer.java is the server\\nprogram, which keeps the list of available users and makes th at list available to clients. Ideally ,\\nthe server program would run constantly (as a daemon) on a com puter and port that are known\\nto all the possible client users. F or testing, of course, it c an simply be stated like any other\\nprogram. The client program is BuddyChat.java. This program is to be run by any user who\\nwants to use the BuddyChat service. When a user starts the client program, it connects t o the\\nserver, and it gets from the server a list of other users who ar e currently connected. The list\\nis displayed to the user of the client program, who can send a r equest for a chat connection\\nwith any user on the list. The client can also receive incomin g chat connection requests from\\nother users. The window that is used for chatting is deﬁned by BuddyChatWindow.java, which\\nis not itself a program but just a subclass of JFrame that deﬁnes the chat window. (There is\\nalso a fourth piece, BuddyChatServerShutdown.java. This is a program that can be run to shut\\ndown the BuddyChatServer gracefully . I will not discuss it further here. See the sourc e code\\nfor more information, if you are interested.)\\nI urge you to compile the programs and try them out. F or testin g, you can try them\\non a single computer (although all the windows can get a littl e confusing). First, start\\nBuddyChatServer. The server has no GUI interface, but it does print some infor mation to\\nstandard output as it runs. Then start the BuddyChat client program. When BuddyChat starts\\nup, it presents a window where you can enter the name and port n umber for the server and your'),\n",

The server\\ninfo is already set up to connect to a server on the same machin e. When you hit the “Connect”\\nbutton, a new window will open with a list, currently empty , o f other users connected to the\\nserver. Now, start another copy of the BuddyChat client program. When you click “Connect”,\\nyou’ll have two client list windows, one for each copy of the c lient program that you’ve started.\\n(One of these windows will be exactly on top of the other, so yo u’ll have to move it to see the\\nsecond window.) Each client window will display the other cl ient in its list of users. Y ou can\\nrun additional copies of the client program, if you want, and you might want to try connecting\\nfrom another computer if one is available.\\nAt this point, there is a network connection in place between the server and each client.\\nWhenever a client connects to or disconnects from the server , the server sends a notiﬁcation\\nof the event to each connected client, so that the client can m odify its own list of connected\\nusers. The server also maintains a listening socket that lis tens for connection requests from new\\nclients. In order to manage all this, the server is running se veral threads. One thread waits\\nfor connection requests on the listening socket. In additio n to this, there are two threads for\\neach connected client—one thread for sending messages to th e client and one thread for reading\\nmessages sent by the client to the server.\\nBack to trying out the program. Remember that the whole point was to provide each user\\nwith a list of potential chat partners. Click on a user in one o f the client user lists, and then\\nclick the “Connect to Selected Buddy” button. When you do thi s, your BuddyChat program\\nsends a connection request to the BuddyChat program that is being run by the selected user.\\nEach BuddyChat program, one on each side of the connection, opens a chat wind ow (of type\\nBuddyChatWindow ). A network connection between these two windows is set up wi thout any\\nfurther action on the part of the two users, and the users can u se the windows to send messages\\nback and forth to each other. The BuddyChatServer program has nothing to do with opening,\\nclosing, or using the connection between its two clients (al though a diﬀerent design might have\\nhad the messages go through the server).\\nIn order to open the chat connection from one program to anoth er, the second program\\nmust be listening for connection requests and the ﬁrst progr am must know the computer and\\nport on which the ﬁrst user is listening. In the BuddyChat system, the BuddyChatServer knows\\nthis information and provides it to each BuddyChat client program. The users of the client\\nprograms never have to be aware of this information.\\nHow does the server know about the clients’ computers and por t numbers? When a Bud-\\ndyChat client program is run, in addition to opening a connection to the BuddyChatServer, the\\nclient also creates a listening socket to accept connection requests from other users. When the\\nclient registers with the server, it tells the server the por t number of the client’s listening socket.\\nThe server also knows the IP address of the computer on which t he client is running, since it has\\na network connection to that computer. This means that the BuddyChatServer knows the IP\\naddress and listening socket port number of every BuddyChat client. A copy of this information\\nis provided (along with the users’ handles) to each connecte d client program. The net result is\\nthat every BuddyChat client program has the information that it needs to contact a ll the other\\nclients.\\nThe basic techniques used in the BuddyChat system are the same as those used in previous\\nnetworking examples: server sockets, client sockets, inpu t and output streams for sending\\nmessages over the network, and threads to handle the communi cation. The important diﬀerence\\nis how these basic building blocks are combined to build a mor e complex application. I have\\ntried to explain the logic of that application here. I will no t discuss the BuddyChat source code'),\n",

FILES AND NETWORKING\\nhere, since it is locally similar to examples that we have alr eady looked at, but I encourage you\\nto study the source code if you are interested in network prog ramming.\\nBuddyChat seems to have a lot of functionality , yet I said it was still a “ toy” program.\\nWhat exactly makes it a toy? There are at least two big problem s. First of all, it is not\\nscalable. A network program is scalable if it will work well for a large number of simultaneous\\nusers. BuddyChat would have problems with a large number of users because it us es so many\\nthreads (two for each user). It takes a certain amount of proc essing for a computer to switch its\\nattention from one thread to another. On a very busy server, t he constant switching between\\nthreads would soon start to degrade the performance. One sol ution to this is to use a more\\nadvanced network API. Java has a class SelectableChannel that makes it possible for one thread\\nto manage communication over a large number of network conne ctions. This class is part of\\nthe package java.nio that provides a number of advanced I/O capabilities for work ing with\\nﬁles and networking. However, I will not cover those capabil ities in this book.\\nBut the biggest problem is that BuddyChat oﬀers absolutely no defense against denial of\\nservice attacks. In a denial of service, a malicious user attacks a ne twork server in some way\\nthat prevents other users from accessing the service or seve rely degrades the performance of the\\nservice for those users. It would be simple to launch a denial of service attack on BuddyChat\\nby making a huge number of connections to the server. The serv er would then spend most of\\nits time servicing those bogus connections. The server coul d guard against this to some extent\\nby putting a limit on the number of simultaneous connections that it will accept from a given\\nIP address. It would also be helpful to add some security to th e server by requiring users to\\nknow a password in order to connect. However, neither of thes e measures would fully solve the\\nproblem, and it is very diﬃcult to ﬁnd a complete defense agai nst denial of service attacks.\\n11.5.3 Distributed Computing\\nIn Section 8.5, we saw how threads can be used to do parallel pr ocessing, where a number of\\nprocessors work together to complete some task. In that sect ion, it was assumed that all the\\nprocessors were inside one multi-processor computer. But p arallel processing can also be done\\nusing processors that are in diﬀerent computers, as long as t hose computers are connected to a\\nnetwork over which they can communicate. This type of parall el processing—in which a number\\nof computers work together on a task and communicate over a ne twork—is called distributed\\ncomputing.\\nIn some sense, the whole Internet is an immense distributed c omputation, but here I am\\ninterested in how computers on a network can cooperate to sol ve some computational problem.\\nThere are several approaches to distributed computing that are supported in Java. RMI and\\nCORBA are standards that enable a program running on one computer t o call methods in\\nobjects that exist on other computers. This makes it possibl e to design an object-oriented\\nprogram in which diﬀerent parts of the program are executed o n diﬀerent computers. RMI\\n(Remote Method Invocation) only supports communication be tween Java objects. CORBA\\n(Common Object Request Broker Architecture) is a more gener al standard that allows objects\\nwritten in various programming languages, including Java, to communicate with each other.\\nAs is commonly the case in networking, there is the problem of locating services (where in this\\ncase, a “service” means an object that is available to be call ed over the network). That is, how\\ncan one computer know which computer a service is located on a nd what port it is listening\\non? RMI and CORBA solve this problem using something like our little BuddyChatServer\\nexample—a server running at a known location keeps a list of s ervices that are available on other\\ncomputers. Computers that oﬀer services register those ser vices with the server; computers that'),\n",

I mention them here\\nbecause they are part of Java’s standard network API, but I wi ll not discuss them further.\\nInstead, we will look at a relatively simple demonstration o f distributed computing that is uses\\nonly basic networking.\\nThe problem that we will look at uses the simplest type of para llel programming, in which\\nthe problem can be broken down into tasks that can be performe d independently , with no\\ncommunication between the tasks. T o apply distributed comp uting to this type of problem,\\nwe can use one “master” program that divides the problem into tasks and sends those tasks\\nover the network to “worker” programs that do the actual work . The worker programs send\\ntheir results back to the master program, which combines the results from all the tasks into a\\nsolution of the overall problem. In this context, the worker programs are often called “slaves,”\\nand the program uses the so-called master/slave approach to distributed computing.\\nThe demonstration program is deﬁned by three source code ﬁle s: CLMandelbrotMas-\\nter.java deﬁnes the master program; CLMandelbrotWorker.java deﬁnes the worker programs;\\nand CLMandelbrotTask.java deﬁnes the class, CLMandelbrotT ask, that represents an individ-\\nual task that is performed by the workers. T o run the demonstr ation, you must start the\\nCLMandelbrotWorker program on several computers (probably by running it on the c ommand\\nline). This program uses CLMandelbrotT ask, so both class ﬁles, CLMandelbrotWorker.class\\nand CLMandelbrotTask.class, must be present on the worker computers. Y ou can then run\\nCLMandelbrotMaster on the master computer. Note that this program also requires the class\\nCLMandelbrotT ask. Y ou must specify the host name or IP address of each of the wor ker com-\\nputers as command line arguments for CLMandelbrotMaster. A worker programs listens for\\nconnection requests from the master program, and the master program must be told where\\nto send those requests. F or example, if the worker program is running on three comput-\\ners with IP addresses 172.30.217.101, 172.30.217.102, and 172.30.217.103, then you can run\\nCLMandelbrotMaster with the command\\njava CLMandelbrotMaster 172.30.217.101 172.30.217.102 1 72.30.217.103\\nThe master will make a network connection to the worker at eac h IP address; these connections\\nwill be used for communication between the master program an d the workers.\\nIt is possible to run several copies of CLMandelbrotWorker on the same computer, but\\nthey must listen for network connections on diﬀerent ports. It is also possible to run\\nCLMandelbrotWorker on the same computer as CLMandelbrotMaster. Y ou might even see\\nsome speed-up when you do this, if your computer has several p rocessors. See the comments in\\nthe program source code ﬁles for more information, but here a re some commands that you can\\nuse to run the master program and two copies of the worker prog ram on the same computer.\\nGive these commands in separate command windows:\\njava CLMandelbrotWorker (Listens on default port)\\njava CLMandelbrotWorker 1501 (Listens on port 1501)\\njava CLMandelbrotMaster localhost localhost:1501\\nEvery time CLMandelbrotMaster is run, it solves exactly the same problem. (F or this\\ndemonstration, the nature of the problem is not important, b ut the problem is to compute the\\ndata needed for a picture of a small piece of the famous “Mande lbrot Set.” If you are interested\\nin seeing the picture that is produced, uncomment the call to the saveImage() method at the'),\n",

W e will encounter the Mandelbrot Set\\nagain as an example in Chapter 12.)\\nY ou can run CLMandelbrotMaster with diﬀerent numbers of worker programs to see how\\nthe time required to solve the problem depends on the number o f workers. (Note that the\\nworker programs continue to run after the master program exi sts, so you can run the mas-\\nter program several times without having to restart the work ers.) In addition, if you run\\nCLMandelbrotMaster with no command line arguments, it will solve the entire prob lem on its\\nown, so you can see how long it takes to do so without using dist ributed computing. In a trial\\nthat I ran, it took 40 seconds for CLMandelbrotMaster to solve the problem on its own. Using\\njust one worker, it took 43 seconds. The extra time represent s extra work involved in using the\\nnetwork; it takes time to set up a network connection and to se nd messages over the network.\\nUsing two workers (on diﬀerent computers), the problem was s olved in 22 seconds. In this case,\\neach worker did about half of the work, and their computation s were performed in parallel,\\nso that the job was done in about half the time. With larger num bers of workers, the time\\ncontinued to decrease, but only up to a point. The master prog ram itself has a certain amount\\nof work to do, no matter how many workers there are, and the tot al time to solve the problem\\ncan never be less than the time it takes for the master program to do its part. In this case, the\\nminimum time seemed to be about ﬁve seconds.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nLet’s take a look at how this distributed application is prog rammed. The master program\\ndivides the overall problem into a set of tasks. Each task is r epresented by an object of type\\nCLMandelbrotT ask. These tasks have to be communicated to the worker programs, and the\\nworker programs must send back their results. Some protocol is needed for this communication.\\nI decided to use character streams. The master encodes a task as a line of text, which is sent\\nto a worker. The worker decodes the text (into an object of typ e CLMandelbrotT ask) to ﬁnd\\nout what task it is supposed to perform. It performs the assig ned task. It encodes the results\\nas another line of text, which it sends back to the master prog ram. Finally , the master decodes\\nthe results and combines them with the results from other tas ks. After all the tasks have been\\ncompleted and their results have been combined, the problem has been solved.\\nThe problem is divided into a fairly large number of tasks. A w orker receives not just\\none task, but a sequence of tasks. Each time it ﬁnishes a task a nd sends back the result, it\\nis assigned a new task. After all tasks are complete, the work er receives a “close” command\\nthat tells it to close the connection. In CLMandelbrotWorker.java, all this is done in a method\\nnamed handleConnection() that is called to handle a connection that has already been op ened\\nto the master program. It uses a method readTask() to decode a task that it receives from\\nthe master and a method writeResults() to encode the results of the task for transmission\\nback to the master. It must also handle any errors that occur:\\nprivate static void handleConnection(Socket connection) {\\ntry {\\nBufferedReader in = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader(\\nconnection.getInputStream()) );\\nPrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(connection.getOutputStream());\\nwhile (true) {\\nString line = in.readLine(); // Message from the master.\\nif (line == null) {\\n// End-of-steram encountered -- should not happen.\\nthrow new Exception(\"Connection closed unexpectedly.\");\\n}'),\n",

The worker has only one thing t o\\ndo at a time and does not need to be multithreaded.\\nY ou might wonder why so many tasks are used. Why not just divid e the problem into one\\ntask for each worker? The reason is that using a larger number of tasks makes it possible to do\\nload balancing . Not all tasks take the same amount of time to execute. This is true for many\\nreasons. Some of the tasks might simply be more computationa lly complex than others. Some\\nof the worker computers might be slower than others. Or some w orker computers might be\\nbusy running other programs, so that they can only give part o f their processing power to the\\nworker program. If we assigned one task per worker, it is poss ible that a complex task running\\non a slow, busy computer would take much longer than the other tasks to complete. This would\\nleave the other workers idle and delay the completion of the j ob while that worker completes its\\ntask. T o complete the job as quickly as possible, we want to ke ep all the workers busy and have\\nthem all ﬁnish at about the same time. This is called load bala ncing. If we have a large number\\nof tasks, the load will automatically be approximately bala nced: A worker is not assigned a\\nnew task until it ﬁnishes the task that it is working on. A slow worker, or one that happens to\\nreceive more complex tasks, will complete fewer tasks than o ther workers, but all workers will\\nbe kept busy until close to the end of the job. On the other hand , individual tasks shouldn’t be\\ntoo small. Network communication takes some time. If it take s longer to transmit a task and\\nits results than it does to perform the task, then using distr ibuted computing will take more'),\n",

A proble m is a good candidate for\\ndistributed computing if it can be divided into a fairly larg e number of fairly large tasks.\\nT uring to the master program, CLMandelbrotMaster.java, we encounter a more complex\\nsituation. The master program must communicate with severa l workers over several network\\nconnections. T o accomplish this, the master program is mult i-threaded, with one thread to\\nmanage communication with each worker. A pseudocode outlin e of the main() routine is quite\\nsimple:\\ncreate a list of all tasks that must be performed\\nif there are no command line arguments {\\n// The master program does all the tasks itself.\\nPerform each task.\\n}\\nelse {\\n// The tasks will be performed by worker programs.\\nfor each command line argument:\\nGet information about a worker from command line argument.\\nCreate and start a thread to communicate with the worker.\\nWait for all threads to terminate.\\n}\\n// All tasks are now complete (assuming no error occurred).\\nThe list of tasks is stored in a variable, tasks, of type ArrayList<CLMandelbrotT ask>. The\\ncommunication threads take tasks from this list and send the m to worker programs. The\\nmethod getNextTask() gets one task from the list. If the list is empty , it returns null as a\\nsignal that all tasks have been assigned and the communicati on thread can terminate. Since\\ntasks is a resource that is shared by several threads, access to it m ust be controlled; this is\\naccomplished by writing getNextTask() as a synchronized method:\\nsynchronized private static CLMandelbrotTask getNextTask() {\\nif (tasks.size() == 0)\\nreturn null;\\nelse\\nreturn tasks.remove(0);\\n}\\n(The reason for the synchronization is to avoid the race cond ition that could occur between\\nthe time that the value of tasks.size() is tested and the time that tasks.remove() is\\ncalled. See Subsection 8.5.3 for information about paralle l programming, race conditions, and\\nsynchronized.)\\nThe job of a thread is to send a sequence of tasks to a worker thr ead and to receive the\\nresults that the worker sends back. The thread is also respon sible for opening the connection\\nin the ﬁrst place. A pseudocode outline for the process execu ted by the thread might look like:\\nCreate a socket connected to the worker program.\\nCreate input and output streams for communicating with the worker.\\nwhile (true) {\\nLet task = getNextTask().\\nIf task == null\\nbreak; // All tasks have been assigned.\\nEncode the task into a message and transmit it to the worker.\\nRead the response from the worker.\\nDecode and process the response.\\n}'),\n",

NETWORK PROGRAMMING AND THREADS 593\\nSend a \"close\" command to the worker.\\nClose the socket.\\nThis would work OK. However, there are a few subtle points. Fi rst of all, the thread must be\\nready to deal with a network error. F or example, a worker migh t shut down unexpectedlyy . But\\nif that happens, the master program can continue, provided o ther workers are still available.\\n(Y ou can try this when you run the program: Stop one of the work er programs, with CONTROL-C,\\nand observe that the master program still completes success fully .) A diﬃculty arises if an\\nerror occurs while the thread is working on a task: If the prob lem as a whole is going to be\\ncompleted, that task will have to be reassigned to another wo rker. I take care of this by putting\\nthe uncompleted task back into the task list. (Unfortunatel y , my program does not handle all\\npossible errors. If a network connection “hangs” indeﬁnite ly without actually generating an\\nerror, my program will also hang, waiting for a response from a worker that will never arrive. A\\nmore robust program would have some way of detecting the prob lem and reassigning the task.)\\nAnother defect in the procedure outlined above is that it lea ves the worker program idle\\nwhile the thread is processing the worker’s response. It wou ld be nice to get a new task to the\\nworker before processing the response from the previous tas k. This would keep the worker busy\\nand allow two operations to proceed simultaneously instead of sequentially . (In this example,\\nthe time it takes to process a response is so short that keepin g the worker waiting while it is\\ndone probably makes no signiﬁcant diﬀerence.

FILES AND NETWORKING\\n11.6 A Brief Introduction to XML\\nWhen data is savedto a ﬁle or transmitted over a network, it must be represented in some\\nway that will allow the same data to be rebuilt later, when the ﬁle is read or the transmission\\nis received. W e have seen that there are good reasons to prefe r textual, character-based rep-\\nresentations in many cases, but there are many ways to repres ent a given collection of data as\\ntext. In this section, we’ll take a brief look at one type of ch aracter-based data representation\\nthat has become increasingly common.\\nXML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a syntax for creating data r epresentation languages.\\nThere are two aspects or levels of XML. On the ﬁrst level, XML s peciﬁes a strict but relatively\\nsimple syntax. Any sequence of characters that follows that syntax is a well-formed XML\\ndocument. On the second level, XML provides a way of placing f urther restrictions on what\\ncan appear in a document. This is done by associating a DTD (Document Type Deﬁnition)\\nwith an XML document. A DTD is essentially a list of things tha t are allowed to appear in the\\nXML document. A well-formed XML document that has an associa ted DTD and that follows\\nthe rules of the DTD is said to be a valid XML document. The idea is that XML is a general\\nformat for data representation, and a DTD speciﬁes how to use XML to represent a particular\\nkind of data. (There is also an alternative to DTDs, known as XML schemas , for deﬁning\\nvalid XLM documents, but let’s ignore them here.)\\nThere is nothing magical about XML. It’s certainly not perfe ct. It’s a very verbose language,\\nand some people think it’s ugly . On the other hand it’s very ﬂe xible; it can be used to represent\\nalmost any type of data. It was built from the start to support all languages and alphabets.\\nMost important, it has become an accepted standard. There is support in just about any\\nprogramming language for processing XML documents. There a re standard DTDs for describing\\nmany diﬀerent kinds of data. There are many ways to design a da ta representation language,\\nbut XML is the one that has happened to come into widespread us e. In fact, it has found its way\\ninto almost every corner of information technology . F or exa mple: There are XML languages for\\nrepresenting mathematical expressions (MathML), musical notation (MusicXML), molecules\\nand chemical reactions (CML), vector graphics (SVG), and ma ny other kinds of information.\\nXML is used by OpenOﬃce and recent versions of Microsoft Oﬃce in the document format\\nfor oﬃce applications such as word processing, spreadsheet s, and presentations. XML site\\nsyndication languages (RSS, A TOM) make it possible for web s ites, newspapers, and blogs to\\nmake a list of recent headlines available in a standard forma t that can be used by other web\\nsites and by web browsers; the same format is used to publish p odcasts. And XML is a common\\nformat for the electronic exchange of business information .\\nMy purpose here is not to tell you everything there is to know a bout XML. I will just\\nexplain a few ways in which it can be used in your own programs. In particular, I will not\\nsay anything further about DTDs and valid XML. F or many purpo ses, it is suﬃcient to use\\nwell-formed XML documents with no associated DTDs.\\n11.6.1 Basic XML Syntax\\nAn XML document looks a lot like an HTML document (see Subsect ion 6.2.3). HTML is not\\nitself an XML language, since it does not follow all the stric t XML syntax rules, but the basic\\nideas are similar. Here is a short, well-formed XML document :\\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\\n<simplepaint version=\"1.0\">\\n<background red=’255’ green=’153’ blue=’51’/>'),\n",

This line can\\nalso specify other information, such as the character encod ing that was used to encode the\\ncharacters in the document into binary form. If this documen t had an associated DTD, it\\nwould be speciﬁed in a “DOCTYPE” directive on the next line of the ﬁle.\\nAside from the ﬁrst line, the document is made up of elements, attributes, and textual\\ncontent. An element starts with a tag , such as <curve> and ends with a matching end-tag\\nsuch as </curve>. Between the tag and end-tag is the content of the element, which can\\nconsist of text and nested elements. (In the example, the onl y textual content is the true or\\nfalse in the <symmetric> elements.) If an element has no content, then the opening tag and\\nend-tag can be combined into a single empty tag , such as <point x=’83’ y=’96’/>, which\\nis an abbreviation for <point x=’83’ y=’96’></point>. A tag can include attributes such as\\nthe x and y in <point x=’83’ y=’96’/> or the version in <simplepaint version=\"1.0\">.\\nA document can also include a few other things, such as commen ts, that I will not discuss here.\\nThe basic structure should look familiar to someone familia r with HTML. The most striking\\ndiﬀerence is that in XML, you get to choose the tags . Whereas HTML comes with a ﬁxed,\\nﬁnite set of tags, with XML you can make up meaningful tag name s that are appropriate to\\nyour application and that describe the data that is being rep resented. (F or an XML document\\nthat uses a DTD, it’s the author of the DTD who gets to choose th e tag names.)\\nEvery well-formed XML document follows a strict syntax. Her e are some of the most\\nimportant syntax rules: T ag names and attribute names in XML are case sensitive. A name\\nmust begin with a letter and can contain letters, digits and c ertain other characters. Spaces\\nand ends-of-line are signiﬁcant only in textual content. Ev ery tag must either be an empty\\ntag or have a matching end-tag. By “matching” here, I mean tha t elements must be properly\\nnested; if a tag is inside some element, then the matching end -tag must also be inside that\\nelement. A document must have a root element , which contains all the other elements. The\\nroot element in the above example has tag name simplepaint. Every attribute must have\\na value, and that value must be enclosed in quotation marks; e ither single quotes or double'),\n",

The entities &gt;, &quot;, and &apos; are also deﬁned, representing >, double\\nquote, and single quote. (Additional entities can be deﬁned in a DTD.)\\nWhile this description will not enable you to understand eve rything that you might en-\\ncounter in XML documents, it should allow you to design well- formed XML documents to\\nrepresent data structures used in Java programs.\\n11.6.2 XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder\\nW e will look at two approaches to representing data from Java programs in XML format. One\\napproach is to design a custom XML language for the speciﬁc da ta structures that you want to\\nrepresent. W e will consider this approach in the next subsec tion. First, we’ll look at an easy way\\nto store data in XML ﬁles and to read those ﬁles back into a prog ram. The technique uses the\\nclasses XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder. These classes are deﬁned in the package java.beans. An\\nXMLEncoder can be used to write objects to an OutputStream in XML form. An XMLDecoder\\ncan be used to read the output of an XMLEncoder and reconstruct the objects that were written\\nby it. XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder have much the same functionality as ObjectOutputStream\\nand ObjectInputStream and are used in much the same way . In fact, you don’t even have t o\\nknow anything about XML to use them. However, you do need to kn ow a little about Java\\nbeans.\\nA Java bean is just an object that has certain characteristic s. The class that deﬁnes a\\nJava bean must be a public class. It must have a constructor that takes no parameters. I t\\nshould have a “get” method and a “set” method for each of its im portant instance variables.\\n(See Subsection 5.1.3). The last rule is a little vague. The i dea is that is should be possible\\nto inspect all aspects of the object’s state by calling “get” methods, and it should be possible\\nto set all aspects of the state by calling “set” methods. A bea n is not required to implement\\nany particular interface; it is recognized as a bean just by having the right character istics.\\nUsually , Java beans are passive data structures that are act ed upon by other objects but don’t\\ndo much themselves.\\nXMLEncoder and XMLDecoder can’t be used with arbitrary objects; they can only be used\\nwith beans. When an XMLEncoder writes an object, it uses the “get” methods of that object\\nto ﬁnd out what information needs to be saved. When an XMLDecoder reconstructs an object,\\nit creates the object using the constructor with no paramete rs and it uses “set” methods to\\nrestore the object’s state to the values that were saved by th e XMLEncoder. (Some standard\\njava classes are processed using additional techniques. F o r example, a diﬀerent constructor\\nmight be used, and other methods might be used to inspect and r estore the state.)\\nF or an example, we return to the same SimplePaint example that was used in Subsec-\\ntion 11.3.4. Suppose that we want to use XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder to create and read\\nﬁles in that program. Part of the data for a SimplePaint sketch is stored in objects of type\\nCurveData, deﬁned as:\\nprivate static class CurveData {\\nColor color; // The color of the curve.\\nboolean symmetric; // Are reflections also drawn?\\nArrayList<Point> points; // The points on the curve.\\n}\\nT o use such objects with XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder, we have to modify this class so that'),\n",

A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO XML 599\\nit follows the Java bean pattern. The class has to be public, a nd we need get and set methods\\nfor each instance variable. This gives:\\npublic static class CurveData {\\nprivate Color color; // The color of the curve.\\nprivate boolean symmetric; // Are reflections also drawn?\\nprivate ArrayList<Point> points; // The points on the curve .\\npublic Color getColor() {\\nreturn color;\\n}\\npublic void setColor(Color color) {\\nthis.color = color;\\n}\\npublic ArrayList<Point> getPoints() {\\nreturn points;\\n}\\npublic void setPoints(ArrayList<Point> points) {\\nthis.points = points;\\n}\\npublic boolean isSymmetric() {\\nreturn symmetric;\\n}\\npublic void setSymmetric(boolean symmetric) {\\nthis.symmetric = symmetric;\\n}\\n}\\nI didn’t really need to make the instance variables private, but bean properties are usually\\nprivate and are accessed only through their get and set methods.\\nAt this point, we might deﬁne another bean class, SketchData, to hold all the necessary\\ndata for representing the user’s picture. If we did that, we c ould write the data to a ﬁle with a\\nsingle output statement. In my program, however, I decided t o write the data in several pieces.\\nAn XMLEncoder can be constructed to write to any output stream. The output s tream is\\nspeciﬁed in the encoder’s constructor. F or example, to crea te an encoder for writing to a ﬁle:\\nXMLEncoder encoder;\\ntry {\\nFileOutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(selectedFile);\\nencoder = new XMLEncoder( stream );\\n.\\n.\\nOnce an encoder has been created, its writeObject() method is used to write objects, coded\\ninto XML form, to the stream. In the SimplePaint program, I save the background color, the\\nnumber of curves in the picture, and the data for each curve. T he curve data are stored in a\\nlist of type ArrayList<CurveData> named curves. So, a complete representation of the user’s\\npicture can be created with:\\nencoder.writeObject(getBackground());\\nencoder.writeObject(new Integer(curves.size()));\\nfor (CurveData c : curves)\\nencoder.writeObject(c);\\nencoder.close();'),\n",

FILES AND NETWORKING\\nWhen reading the data back into the program, an XMLDecoder is created to read from an\\ninput ﬁle stream. The objects are then read, using the decode r’s readObject() method, in the\\nsame order in which they were written. Since the return type o f readObject() is Object, the\\nreturned values must be type-cast to their correct type:\\nColor bgColor = (Color)decoder.readObject();\\nInteger curveCt = (Integer)decoder.readObject();\\nArrayList<CurveData> newCurves = new ArrayList<CurveData>();\\nfor (int i = 0; i < curveCt; i++) {\\nCurveData c = (CurveData)decoder.readObject();\\nnewCurves.add(c);\\n}\\ndecoder.close();\\ncurves = newCurves; // Replace the program’s data with data from the file.\\nsetBackground(bgColor);\\nrepaint();\\nY ou can look at the sample program SimplePaintWithXMLEncoder.java to see this code in\\nthe context of a complete program. Files are created by the me thod doSaveAsXML() and are\\nread by doOpenAsXML().\\nThe XML format used by XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder is more robust than the binary\\nformat used for object streams and is more appropriate for lo ng-term storage of objects in ﬁles.\\n11.6.3 Working With the DOM\\nThe output produced by an XMLEncoder tends to be long and not very easy for a human reader\\nto understand. It would be nice to represent data in a more com pact XML format that uses\\nmeaningful tag names to describe the data and makes more sens e to human readers. W e’ll look\\nat yet another version of SimplePaint that does just that. See SimplePaintWithXML.java for\\nthe source code. The sample XML document shown earlier in thi s section was produced by this\\nprogram. I designed the format of that document to represent all the data needed to reconstruct\\na picture in SimplePaint. The document encodes the background color of the picture an d a\\nlist of curves. Each <curve> element contains the data from one object of type CurveData.\\nIt is easy enough to write data in a customized XML format, alt hough we have to be very\\ncareful to follow all the syntax rules. Here is how I write the data for a SimplePaint picture\\nto a PrintWriter, out:\\nout.println(\"<?xml version=\\\\\"1.0\\\\\"?>\");\\nout.println(\"<simplepaint version=\\\\\"1.0\\\\\">\");\\nColor bgColor = getBackground();\\nout.println(\" <background red=’\" + bgColor.getRed() + \"’ g reen=’\" +\\nbgColor.getGreen() + \"’ blue=’\" + bgColor.getBlue() + \"’/>\");\\nfor (CurveData c : curves) {\\nout.println(\" <curve>\");\\nout.println(\" <color red=’\" + c.color.getRed() + \"’ green= ’\" +\\nc.color.getGreen() + \"’ blue=’\" + c.color.getBlue() + \"’/>\");\\nout.println(\" <symmetric>\" + c.symmetric + \"</symmetric> \");\\nfor (Point pt : c.points)\\nout.println(\" <point x=’\" + pt.x + \"’ y=’\" + pt.y + \"’/>\");\\nout.println(\" </curve>\");\\n}\\nout.println(\"</simplepaint>\");'),\n",

A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO XML 601\\nReading the data back into the program is another matter. T o r econstruct the data structure\\nrepresented by the XML Document, it is necessary to parse the document and extract the data\\nfrom it. F ortunately , Java has a standard API for parsing and processing XML Documents.\\n(Actually , it has two, but we will only look at one of them.)\\nA well-formed XML document has a certain structure, consist ing of elements containing\\nattributes, nested elements, and textual content. It’s pos sible to build a data structure in the\\ncomputer’s memory that corresponds to the structure and con tent of the document. Of course,\\nthere are many ways to do this, but there is one common standar d representation known as\\nthe Document Object Model , or DOM. The DOM speciﬁes how to build data structures\\nto represent XML documents, and it speciﬁes some standard me thods for accessing the data\\nin that structure. The data structure is a kind of tree whose s tructure mirrors the structure\\nof the document. The tree is constructed from nodes of various types. There are nodes to\\nrepresent elements, attributes, and text. (The tree can als o contain several other types of node,\\nrepresenting aspects of XML that we can ignore here.) Attrib utes and text can be processed\\nwithout directly manipulating the corresponding nodes, so we will be concerned almost entirely\\nwith element nodes.\\nThe sample program XMLDemo.java lets you experiment with XML and the DOM. It has a\\ntext area where you can enter an XML document. Initially , the input area contains the sample\\nXML document from this section. When you click a button named “Parse XML Input”, the\\nprogram will attempt to read the XML from the input box and bui ld a DOM representation of\\nthat document. If the input is not legal XML, an error message is displayed. If it is legal, the\\nprogram will traverse the DOM representation and display a l ist of elements, attributes, and\\ntextual content that it encounteres. (The program uses a few techniques that I won’t discuss\\nhere.)\\nIn Java, the DOM representation of an XML document ﬁle can be c reated with just two\\nstatements. If selectedFile is a variable of type File that represents the XML ﬁle, then\\nDocumentBuilder docReader\\n= DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder();\\nxmldoc = docReader.parse(selectedFile);\\nwill open the ﬁle, read its contents, and build the DOM repres entation. The classes Document-\\nBuilder and DocumentBuilderFactory are both deﬁned in the package javax.xml.parsers. The\\nmethod docReader.parse() does the actual work. It will throw an exception if it can’t re ad\\nthe ﬁle or if the ﬁle does not contain a legal XML document. If i t succeeds, then the value\\nreturned by docReader.parse() is an object that represents the entire XML document. (This\\nis a very complex task! It has been coded once and for all into a method that can be used very\\neasily in any Java program. W e see the beneﬁt of using a standa rdized syntax.)\\nThe structure of the DOM data structure is deﬁned in the packa ge org.w3c.dom, which\\ncontains several data types that represent an XML document a s a whole and the individual\\nnodes in a document. The “org.w3c” in the name refers to the W o rld Wide W eb Consortium,\\nW3C, which is the standards organization for the W eb. DOM, li ke XML, is a general standard,\\nnot just a Java standard. The data types that we need here are Document, Node, Element, and\\nNodeList. (They are deﬁned as interfaces rather than classes, but that fact is not relevant\\nhere.) W e can use methods that are deﬁned in these data types t o access the data in the DOM\\nrepresentation of an XML document.\\nAn object of type Document represents an entire XML document. The return value of\\ndocReader.parse()— xmldoc in the above example—is of type Document. W e will only need\\none one method from this class: If xmldoc is of type Document, then'),\n",

In the sample XML document\\nfrom earlier in this section, the root element consists of th e tag <simplepaint version=\"1.0\">,\\nthe end-tag </simplepaint>, and everything in between.

If element is of type\\nElement, then we have:\\n• element.getTagName() — returns a String containing the name that is used in the ele-\\nment’s tag. F or example, the name of a <curve> element is the string “curve”.\\n• element.getAttribute(attrName) — if attrName is the name of an attribute in the\\nelement, then this method returns the value of that attribut e. F or the element,\\n<point x=\"83\" y=\"42\"/>, element.getAttribute(\"x\") would return the string “83”.\\nNote that the return value is always a String, even if the attribute is supposed to represent\\na numerical value. If the element has no attribute with the sp eciﬁed name, then the return\\nvalue is an empty string.\\n• element.getTextContent() — returns a String containing all the textual content that\\nis contained in the element. Note that this includes text tha t is contained inside other\\nelements that are nested inside the element.\\n• element.getChildNodes() — returns a value of type NodeList that contains all the Nodes\\nthat are children of the element. The list includes nodes rep resenting other elements and\\ntextual content that are directly nested in the element (as w ell as some other types of node\\nthat I don’t care about here). The getChildNodes() method makes it possible to traverse\\nthe entire DOM data structure by starting with the root eleme nt, looking at children of\\nthe root element, children of the children, and so on. (There is a similar method that\\nreturns the attributes of the element, but I won’t be using it here.)\\n• element.getElementsByTagName(tagName) — returns a NodeList that contains all the\\nnodes representing all elements that are are nested inside element and which have the given\\ntag name. Note that this includes elements that are nested to any level, not just elements\\nthat are directly contained inside element. The getElementsByTagName() method allows\\nyou to reach into the document and pull out speciﬁc data that y ou are interested in.\\nAn object of type NodeList represents a list of Nodes. It does not use the API deﬁned\\nfor lists in the Java Collection F ramework. Instead, a value , nodeList, of type NodeList\\nhas two methods: nodeList.getLength() returns the number of nodes in the list, and\\nnodeList.item(i) returns the node at position i, where the positions are numbered 0, 1,\\n. . . , nodeList.getLength() - 1. Note that the return value of nodeList.get() is of type\\nNode, and it might have to be type-cast to a more speciﬁc node type b efore it is used.\\nKnowing just this much, you can do the most common types of pro cessing of DOM rep-\\nresentations. Let’s look at a few code fragments. Suppose th at in the course of processing a\\ndocument you come across an Element node that represents the element\\n<background red=’255’ green=’153’ blue=’51’/>\\nThis element might be encountered either while traversing t he document with getChildNodes()\\nor in the result of a call to getElementsByTagName(\"background\"). Our goal is to reconstruct\\nthe data structure represented by the document, and this ele ment represents part of that data.\\nIn this case, the element represents a color, and the red, gre en, and blue components are given'),\n",

Our goal\\nis to build the list of type ArrayList<Point> that is represented by the element.

The if statement\\nin this code fragment is necessary because an element can hav e other children in addition to its\\nnested elements. In this example, we only want to process the children that are elements.\\nAll these techniques can be employed to write the ﬁle input me thod for the sample program\\nSimplePaintWithXML.java.

But so me of the ﬁles in that\\ndirectory might themselves be directories. And the subdire ctories can themselves contain\\ndirectories. And so on. W rite a modiﬁed version of DirectoryList that will list all the\\nﬁles in a directory and all its subdirectories, to any level o f nesting. Y ou will need a\\nrecursive subroutine to do the listing. The subroutine should have a pa rameter of type\\nFile. Y ou will need the constructor from the File class that has the form\\npublic File( File dir, String fileName )\\n// Constructs the File object representing a file\\n// named fileName in the directory specified by dir.\\n2. W rite a program that will count the number of lines in each ﬁle that is speciﬁed on the\\ncommand line. Assume that the ﬁles are text ﬁles. Note that mu ltiple ﬁles can be speciﬁed,\\nas in:\\njava LineCounts file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\\nW rite each ﬁle name, along with the number of lines in that ﬁle , to standard output. If an\\nerror occurs while trying to read from one of the ﬁles, you sho uld print an error message\\nfor that ﬁle, but you should still process all the remaining ﬁ les. Do not use T extIO to\\nprocess the ﬁles; use a FileReader to access each ﬁle.\\n3. F or this exercise, you will write a network server program. T he program is a simple ﬁle\\nserver that makes a collection of ﬁles available for transmi ssion to clients. When the server\\nstarts up, it needs to know the name of the directory that cont ains the collection of ﬁles.\\nThis information can be provided as a command-line argument . Y ou can assume that the\\ndirectory contains only regular ﬁles (that is, it does not co ntain any sub-directories). Y ou\\ncan also assume that all the ﬁles are text ﬁles.\\nWhen a client connects to the server, the server ﬁrst reads a o ne-line command from\\nthe client. The command can be the string “ index”. In this case, the server responds by\\nsending a list of names of all the ﬁles that are available on th e server. Or the command\\ncan be of the form “ get filename”, where filename is a ﬁle name. The server checks\\nwhether the requested ﬁle actually exists. If so, it ﬁrst sen ds the word “ok” as a message\\nto the client. Then it sends the contents of the ﬁle and closes the connection. Otherwise,\\nit sends the word “error” to the client and closes the connect ion.\\nIdeally , your server should start a separate thread to handl e each connection request.\\nHowever, if you don’t want to deal with threads you can just ca ll a subroutine to handle the\\nrequest.

This\\nchapter is a further introduction to Swing and other aspects of GUI programming. Although\\nthe title of the chapter is “Advanced GUI Programming,” it is still just an introduction. F ull\\ncoverage of this topic would require at least another comple te book.\\n12.1 Images and Resources\\nWe have seen how to usethe Graphics class to draw on a GUI component that is visible on\\nthe computer’s screen. Often, however, it is useful to be abl e to create a drawing oﬀ-screen ,\\nin the computer’s memory . It is also important to be able to wo rk with images that are stored\\nin ﬁles.\\nT o a computer, an image is just a set of numbers. The numbers sp ecify the color of each\\npixel in the image. The numbers that represent the image on th e computer’s screen are stored\\nin a part of memory called a frame buﬀer . Many times each second, the computer’s video\\ncard reads the data in the frame buﬀer and colors each pixel on the screen according to that\\ndata. Whenever the computer needs to make some change to the s creen, it writes some new\\nnumbers to the frame buﬀer, and the change appears on the scre en a fraction of a second later,\\nthe next time the screen is redrawn by the video card.\\nSince it’s just a set of numbers, the data for an image doesn’t have to be stored in a frame\\nbuﬀer. It can be stored elsewhere in the computer’s memory . I t can be stored in a ﬁle on the\\ncomputer’s hard disk. Just like any other data ﬁle, an image ﬁ le can be downloaded over the\\nInternet. Java includes standard classes and subroutines t hat can be used to copy image data\\nfrom one part of memory to another and to get data from an image ﬁle and use it to display\\nthe image on the screen.\\n12.1.1 Images and BuﬀeredImages\\nThe class java.awt.Image represents an image stored in the computer’s memory .

ADV ANCED GUI PROGRAMMING\\ndrawing surface. It is possible to draw to an oﬀscreen image u sing the same Graphics class that\\nis used for drawing on the screen.\\nAn Image of either type can be copied onto the screen (or onto an oﬀ-scr een canvas)\\nusing methods that are deﬁned in the Graphics class. This is most commonly done in the\\npaintComponent() method of a JComponent. Suppose that g is the Graphics object that is\\nprovided as a parameter to the paintComponent() method, and that img is of type Image.\\nThen the statement\\ng.drawImage(img, x, y, this);\\nwill draw the image img in a rectangular area in the component. The integer-valued p arameters\\nx and y give the position of the upper-left corner of the rectangle i n which the image is displayed,\\nand the rectangle is just large enough to hold the image. The f ourth parameter, this, is the\\nspecial variable from Subsection 5.6.1 that refers to the JComponent itself. This parameter is\\nthere for technical reasons having to do with the funny way Ja va treats image ﬁles. F or most\\napplications, you don’t need to understand this, but here is how it works: g.drawImage() does\\nnot actually draw the image in all cases. It is possible that t he complete image is not available\\nwhen this method is called; this can happen, for example, if t he image has to be read from\\na ﬁle. In that case, g.drawImage() merely initiates the drawing of the image and returns\\nimmediately . Pieces of the image are drawn later, asynchron ously , as they become available.\\nThe question is, how do they get drawn? That’s where the fourth parameter to the drawImage\\nmethod comes in. The fourth parameter is something called an ImageObserver. When a piece\\nof the image becomes available to be drawn, the system will in form the ImageObserver, and\\nthat piece of the image will appear on the screen. Any JComponent object can act as an\\nImageObserver. The drawImage method returns a boolean value to indicate whether the image\\nhas actually been drawn or not when the method returns. When d rawing an image that you\\nhave created in the computer’s memory , or one that you are sur e has already been completely\\nloaded, you can set the ImageObserver parameter to null.\\nThere are a few useful variations of the drawImage() method. F or example, it is possible to\\nscale the image as it is drawn to a speciﬁed width and height. T his is done with the command\\ng.drawImage(img, x, y, width, height, imageObserver);\\nThe parameters width and height give the size of the rectangle in which the image is displayed .\\nAnother version makes it possible to draw just part of the ima ge. In the command:\\ng.drawImage(img, dest x1, dest y1, dest x2, dest y2,\\nsource x1, source y1, source x2, source y2, imageObserver);\\nthe integers source x1, source y1, source x2, and source y2 specify the top-left and bottom-\\nright corners of a rectangular region in the source image. Th e integers dest x1, dest y1,\\ndest x2, and dest y2 specify the corners of a region in the destination graphics c ontext. The\\nspeciﬁed rectangle in the image is drawn, with scaling if nec essary , to the speciﬁed rectangle in\\nthe graphics context. F or an example in which this is useful, consider a card game that needs\\nto display 52 diﬀerent cards. Dealing with 52 image ﬁles can b e cumbersome and ineﬃcient,\\nespecially for downloading over the Internet. So, all the ca rds might be put into a single image:'),\n",

An oﬀ-screen canvas can be represented by an object belonging to the class\\nBuﬀeredImage , which is deﬁned in the package java.awt.image. BuﬀeredImage is a subclass of\\nImage, so that once you have a BuﬀeredImage , you can copy it into a graphics context g using one\\nof the g.drawImage() methods, just as you would do with any other image. A BuﬀeredImage\\ncan be created using the constructor\\npublic BufferedImage(int width, int height, int imageType)\\nwhere width and height specify the width and height of the image in pixels, and imageType\\ncan be one of several constants that are deﬁned in the BuﬀeredImage . The image type\\nspeciﬁes how the color of each pixel is represented. The most likely value for imageType\\nis BufferedImage.TYPE\\nINT RGB, which speciﬁes that the color of each pixel is a usual\\nRGB color, with red, green and blue components in the range 0 t o 255. The image type\\nBufferedImage.TYPE INT ARGB represents an RGB image with “transparency”; see the next\\nsection for more information on this. The image type BufferedImage.TYPE BYTE GRAY can be\\nused to create a grayscale image in which the only possible colors are shades of gray .\\nT o draw to a BuﬀeredImage , you need a graphics context that is set up to do its drawing on\\nthe image. If OSC is of type BuﬀeredImage , then the method\\nOSC.getGraphics()\\nreturns an object of type Graphics that can be used for drawing on the image.\\nThere are several reasons why a programmer might want to draw to an oﬀ-screen canvas.\\nOne is to simply keep a copy of an image that is shown on the scre en. Remember that a picture\\nthat is drawn on a component can be lost, for example when the c omponent is covered by\\nanother window. This means that you have to be able to redraw t he picture on demand, and\\nthat in turn means keeping enough information around to enab le you to redraw the picture.\\nOne way to do this is to keep a copy of the picture in an oﬀ-scree n canvas. Whenever the on-\\nscreen picture needs to be redrawn, you just have to copy the c ontents of the oﬀ-screen canvas\\nonto the screen. Essentially , the oﬀ-screen canvas allows y ou to save a copy of the color of every'),\n",

I n this program, the user can draw\\ncurves, lines, and various shapes; a “T ool” menu allows the u ser to select the thing to be drawn.\\nThere is also an “Erase” tool and a “Smudge” tool that I will ge t to later. A BuﬀeredImage is\\nused to store the user’s picture. When the user changes the pi cture, the changes are made to\\nthe image, and the changed image is then copied to the screen. No record is kept of the shapes\\nthat the user draws; the only record is the color of the indivi dual pixels in the oﬀ-screen image.\\n(Y ou should contrast this with the program SimplePaint2.java in Subsection 7.3.4, where the\\nuser’s drawing is recorded as a list of objects that represen t the shapes that user drew.)\\nY ou should try the program (or the applet version in the on-li ne version of this section). T ry\\ndrawing a Filled Rectangle on top of some other shapes. As you drag the mouse, the rectangle\\nstretches from the starting point of the mouse drag to the cur rent mouse location. As the mouse\\nmoves, the underlying picture seems to be unaﬀected—parts o f the picture can be covered up by\\nthe rectangle and later uncovered as the mouse moves, and they are still there . What this means\\nis that the rectangle that is shown as you drag the mouse can’t actually be part of the oﬀ-screen\\ncanvas, since drawing something into an image means changin g the color of some pixels in the\\nimage. The previous colors of those pixels are not stored any where else and so are permanently\\nlost. In fact, when you draw a line, rectangle, or oval in PaintWithOffScreenCanvas, the shape\\nthat is shown as you drag the mouse is not drawn to the oﬀ-scree n canvas at all. Instead, the\\npaintComponent() method draws the shape on top of the contents of the canvas. On ly when\\nyou release the mouse does the shape become a permanent part o f the oﬀ-screen canvas. This\\nillustrates the point that when an oﬀ-screen canvas is used, not everything that is visible on the\\nscreen has to be drawn on the canvas. Some extra stuﬀ can be dra wn on top of the contents\\nof the canvas by the paintComponent() method. The other tools are handled diﬀerently from\\nthe shape tools. F or the curve, erase, and smudge tools, the c hanges are made to the canvas\\nimmediately , as the mouse is being dragged.\\nLet’s look at how an oﬀ-screen canvas is used in this program. The canvas is represented\\nby an instance variable, OSC, of type BuﬀeredImage . The size of the canvas must be the same\\nsize as the panel on which the canvas is displayed. The size ca n be determined by calling the\\ngetWidth() and getHeight() instance methods of the panel. F urthermore, when the canvas is\\nﬁrst created, it should be ﬁlled with the background color, w hich is represented in the program\\nby an instance variable named fillColor. All this is done by the method:\\n/**\\n* This method creates the off-screen canvas and fills it with the current\\n* fill color.\\n*/\\nprivate void createOSC() {\\nOSC = new BufferedImage(getWidth(),getHeight(),BufferedImage.TYPE\\nINT RGB);\\nGraphics osg = OSC.getGraphics();\\nosg.setColor(fillColor);\\nosg.fillRect(0,0,getWidth(),getHeight());\\nosg.dispose();\\n}\\nNote how it uses OSC.getGraphics() to obtain a graphics context for drawing to the image.\\nAlso note that the graphics context is disposed at the end of t he method. It is good practice\\nto dispose a graphics context when you are ﬁnished with it. Th ere still remains the problem\\nof where to call this method. The problem is that the width and height of the panel object\\nare not set until some time after the panel object is construc ted. If createOSC() is called in'),\n",

The approach that I take in PaintWithOffScreenCanvas\\nis to call createOSC() in the paintComponent() method, the ﬁrst time the paintComponent()\\nmethod is called. At that time, the size of the panel has deﬁni tely been set, but the user has\\nnot yet had a chance to draw anything. With this in mind you are ready to understand the\\npaintComponent() method:\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\\n/* First create the off-screen canvas, if it does not already exist. */\\nif (OSC == null)\\ncreateOSC();\\n/* Copy the off-screen canvas to the panel. Since we know that the\\nimage is already completely available, the fourth \"ImageObserver\"\\nparameter to g.drawImage() can be null. Since the canvas com pletely\\nfills the panel, there is no need to call super.paintComponent(g). */\\ng.drawImage(OSC,0,0,null);\\n/* If the user is currently dragging the mouse to draw a line, oval,\\nor rectangle, draw the shape on top of the image from the off-screen\\ncanvas, using the current drawing color. (This is not done if the\\nuser is drawing a curve or using the smudge tool or the erase tool.) */\\nif (dragging && SHAPE\\nTOOLS.contains(currentTool)) {\\ng.setColor(currentColor);\\nputCurrentShape(g);\\n}\\n}\\nHere, dragging is a boolean instance variable that is set to true while the user is draggi ng the\\nmouse, and currentTool tells which tool is currently in use. The possible tools are d eﬁned by\\nan enum named T ool, and SHAPE\\nTOOLS is a variable of type EnumSet<T ool> that contains the\\nline, oval, rectangle, ﬁlled oval, and ﬁlled rectangle tool s. (See Subsection 10.2.4.)\\nY ou might notice that there is a problem if the size of the pane l is ever changed, since the\\nsize of the oﬀ-screen canvas will not be changed to match. The PaintWithOffScreenCanvas\\nprogram does not allow the user to resize the program’s windo w, so this is not an issue in\\nthat program. If we want to allow resizing, however, a new oﬀ- screen canvas must be created\\nwhenever the size of the panel changes. One simple way to do th is is to check the size of the\\ncanvas in the paintComponent() method and to create a new canvas if the size of the canvas\\ndoes not match the size of the panel:\\nif (OSC == null || getWidth() != OSC.getWidth() || getHeight() != OSC.getHeight())\\ncreateOSC();\\nOf course, this will discard the picture that was contained i n the old canvas unless some ar-\\nrangement is made to copy the picture from the old canvas to th e new one before the old canvas\\nis discarded.\\nThe other point in the program where the oﬀ-screen canvas is u sed is during a mouse-drag\\noperation, which is handled in the mousePressed(), mouseDragged(), and mouseReleased()\\nmethods. The strategy that is implemented was discussed abo ve. Shapes are drawn to the\\noﬀ-screen canvas only at the end of the drag operation, in the mouseReleased() method.'),\n",

IMAGES AND RESOURCES 617\\nHowever, as the user drags the mouse, the part of the image whe re the shape appears is\\nredrawn each time the mouse is moved; the shape that appears o n the screen is drawn on top of\\nthe canvas by the paintComponent() method. F or the other tools, changes are made directly\\nto the canvas, and the region that was changed is repainted so that the change will appear on\\nthe screen. (By the way , the program uses a version of the repaint() method that repaints\\njust a part of a component. The command repaint(x,y,width,height) tells the system to\\nrepaint the rectangle with upper left corner (x,y) and with the speciﬁed width and height.\\nThis can be substantially faster than repainting the entire component.) See the source code,\\nPaintWithOﬀScreenCanvas.java , if you want to see how it’s all done.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nOne traditional use of oﬀ-screen canvasses is for double buﬀering . In double-buﬀering,\\nthe oﬀ-screen image is an exact copy of the image that appears on screen. In double buﬀering,\\nwhenever the on-screen picture needs to be redrawn, the new p icture is drawn step-by-step\\nto an oﬀ-screen image. This can take some time. If all this dra wing were done on screen,\\nthe user would see the image ﬂicker as it is drawn. Instead, th e long drawing process takes\\nplace oﬀ-screen and the completed image is then copied very q uickly onto the screen. The\\nuser doesn’t see all the steps involved in redrawing. This te chnique can be used to implement\\nsmooth, ﬂicker-free animation.\\nThe term “double buﬀering” comes from the term “frame buﬀer, ” which refers to the re-\\ngion in memory that holds the image on the screen. In fact, tru e double buﬀering uses two\\nframe buﬀers. The video card can display either frame buﬀer o n the screen and can switch\\ninstantaneously from one frame buﬀer to the other. One frame buﬀer is used to draw a new\\nimage for the screen. Then the video card is told to switch fro m one frame buﬀer to the other.\\nNo copying of memory is involved. Double-buﬀering as it is im plemented in Java does require\\ncopying, which takes some time and is not perfectly ﬂicker-f ree.\\nIn Java’s older A WT graphical API, it was up to the programmer to do double buﬀering by\\nhand. In the Swing graphical API, double buﬀering is applied automatically by the system, and\\nthe programmer doesn’t have to worry about it. (It is possibl e to turn this automatic double\\nbuﬀering oﬀ in Swing, but there is seldom a good reason to do so .)\\nOne ﬁnal historical note about oﬀ-screen canvasses: There i s an alternative way to create\\nthem. The Component class deﬁnes the following instance method, which can be use d in any\\nGUI component object:\\npublic Image createImage(int width, int height)\\nThis method creates an Image with a speciﬁed width and height. Y ou can use this image\\nas an oﬀ-screen canvas in the same way that you would a BuﬀeredImage . In fact, you can\\nexpect that in a modern version of Java, the image that is retu rned by this method is in fact\\na BuﬀeredImage . The createImage() method was part of Java from the beginning, before the\\nBuﬀeredImage class was introduced.\\n12.1.2 Working With Pixels\\nOne good reason to use a BuﬀeredImage is that it allows easy access to the colors of individual\\npixels. If image is of type BuﬀeredImage , then we have the methods:\\n• image.getRGB(x,y) — returns an int that encodes the color of the pixel at coordinates\\n(x,y) in the image. The values of the integers x and y must lie within the image. That is,'),\n",

ADV ANCED GUI PROGRAMMING\\nit must be true that 0 <= x < image.getWidth() and 0 <= y < image.getHeight();\\nif not, then an exception is thrown.\\n• image.setRGB(x,y,rgb) — sets the color of the pixel at coordinates (x,y) to the color\\nencoded by rgb. Again, x and y must be in the valid range. The third parameter, rgb, is\\nan integer that encodes the color.\\nThese methods use integer codes for colors. If c is of type Color, the integer code for the color\\ncan be obtained by calling c.getRGB(). Conversely , if rgb is an integer that encodes a color,\\nthe corresponding Color object can be obtained with the constructor call new Color(rgb).\\nThis means that you can use\\nColor c = new Color( image.getRGB(x,y) )\\nto get the color of a pixel as a value of type Color. And if c is of type Color, you can set a pixel\\nto that color with\\nimage.setRGB( x, y, c.getRGB() );\\nThe red, green, and blue components of a color are represente d as 8-bit integers, in the\\nrange 0 to 255. When a color is encoded as a single int, the blue component is contained in\\nthe eight low-order bits of the int, the green component in the next lowest eight bits, and the\\nred component in the next eight bits. (The eight high order bi ts store the “alpha component”\\nof the color, which we’ll encounter in the next section.) It i s easy to translate between the two\\nrepresentations using the shift operators << and >> and the bitwise logical operators &\\nand |. (I have not covered these operators previously in this book . Brieﬂy: If A and B are\\nintegers, then A << B is the integer obtained by shifting each bit of A Bbit positions to the left;\\nA >> B is the integer obtained by shifting each bit of A Bbit positions to the right; A & B is the\\ninteger obtained by applying the logical and operation to each pair of bits in A and B; and A | B\\nis obtained similarly , using the logical or operation. F or example, using 8-bit binary numbers,\\nwe have: 01100101 & 10100001 is 00100001, while 01100101 | 10100001 is 11100101.) Y ou\\ndon’t necessarily need to understand these operators. Here are incantations that you can use\\nto work with color codes:\\n/* Suppose that rgb is an int that encodes a color.\\nTo get separate red, green, and blue color components: *;\\nint red = (rgb >> 16) & 0xFF;\\nint green = (rgb >> 8) & 0xFF;\\nint blue = rgb & 0xFF;\\n/* Suppose that red, green, and blue are color components in\\nthe range 0 to 255. To combine them into a single int: */\\nint rgb = (red << 16) | (green << 8) | blue;\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nAn example of using pixel colors in a BuﬀeredImage is provided by the smudge tool in the\\nsample program PaintWithOﬀScreenCanvas.java .

Here’s\\nhow it works: when the user presses the mouse using the smudge tool, the color components\\nof a 7-by-7 block of pixels are copied from the oﬀ-screen canv as into arrays named smudgeRed,\\nsmudgeGreen and smudgeBlue. This is done in the mousePressed() routine with the following\\ncode:\\nint w = OSC.getWidth();\\nint h = OSC.getHeight();\\nint x = evt.getX();\\nint y = evt.getY();\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)\\nfor (int j = 0; j < 7; j++) {\\nint r = y + j - 3;\\nint c = x + i - 3;\\nif (r < 0 || r >= h || c < 0 || c >= w) {\\n// A -1 in the smudgeRed array indicates that the\\n// corresponding pixel was outside the canvas.\\nsmudgeRed[i][j] = -1;\\n}\\nelse {\\nint color = OSC.getRGB(c,r);\\nsmudgeRed[i][j] = (color >> 16) & 0xFF;\\nsmudgeGreen[i][j] = (color >> 8) & 0xFF;\\nsmudgeBlue[i][j] = color & 0xFF;\\n}\\n}\\nThe arrays are of type double[ ][ ]because I am going to do some computations with them that\\nrequire real numbers. As the user moves the mouse, the colors in the array are blended with\\nthe colors in the image, just as if you were mixing wet paint by smudging it with your ﬁnger.\\nThat is, the colors at the new mouse position in the image are r eplaced with a weighted average\\nof the current colors in the image and the colors in the arrays . This has the eﬀect of moving\\nsome of the color from the previous mouse position to the new m ouse position. At the same\\ntime, the colors in the arrays are replaced by a weighted aver age of the colors in the arrays and\\nthe colors from the image. This has the eﬀect of moving some co lor from the image into the\\narrays. This is done using the following code for each pixel p osition, (c,r), in a 7-by-7 block\\naround the new mouse location:\\nint curCol = OSC.getRGB(c,r);\\nint curRed = (curCol >> 16) & 0xFF;\\nint curGreen = (curCol >> 8) & 0xFF;\\nint curBlue = curCol & 0xFF;\\nint newRed = (int)(curRed*0.7 + smudgeRed[i][j]*0.3);\\nint newGreen = (int)(curGreen*0.7 + smudgeGreen[i][j]*0.3);\\nint newBlue = (int)(curBlue*0.7 + smudgeBlue[i][j]*0.3);\\nint newCol = newRed << 16 | newGreen << 8 | newBlue;\\nOSC.setRGB(c,r,newCol);'),\n",

However, programs often use other typ es of data, including images,\\nsounds, and text, as part of their basic structure. These dat a are referred to as resources. An\\nexample is the image ﬁle, cards.png, that was used in the HighLowWithImages.java program\\nearlier in this section. This ﬁle is part of the program. The p rogram needs it in order to run.\\nThe user of the program doesn’t need to know that this ﬁle exis ts or where it is located; as far\\nas the user is concerned, it is just part of the program. The pr ogram of course, does need some\\nway of locating the resource ﬁle and loading its data.\\nResources are ordinarily stored in ﬁles that are in the same l ocations as the compiled class\\nﬁles for the program. Class ﬁles are located and loaded by som ething called a class loader ,\\nwhich is represented in Java by an object of type ClassLoader. A class loader has a list of\\nlocations where it will look for class ﬁles. This list is call ed the class path . It includes the\\nlocation where Java’s standard classes are stored. It gener ally includes the current directory .\\nIf the program is stored in a jar ﬁle, the jar ﬁle is included on the class path. In addition to\\nclass ﬁles, a ClassLoader is capable of locating resource ﬁles that are located on the c lass path\\nor in subdirectories of locations that are on the class path.\\nThe ﬁrst step in using a resource is to obtain a ClassLoader and to use it to locate the\\nresource ﬁle. In the HighLowWithImages program, this is done with:\\nClassLoader cl = HighLowWithImages.class.getClassLoader();\\nURL imageURL = cl.getResource(\"cards.png\");\\nThe idea of the ﬁrst line is that in order to get a class loader, you have to ask a class that\\nwas loaded by the class loader. Here, HighLowWithImages.class is a name for the object that\\nrepresents the actual class HighLowWithImages. In other programs, you would just substitute\\nfor “ HighLowWithImages” the name of the class that contains the call to getClassLoader().\\nThe second line uses the class loader to locate the resource ﬁ le named cards.png. The return\\nvalue of cl.getResource() is of type java.net.URL, and it represents the location of the\\nresource rather than the resource itself. If the resource ﬁl e cannot be found, then the return\\nvalue is null. The class URL was discussed in Subsection 11.4.1.\\nOften, resources are stored not directly on the class path bu t in a subdirectory . In that\\ncase, the parameter to getResource() must be a path name that includes the directory path\\nto the resource. F or example, suppose that the image ﬁle “car ds.png” were stored in a directory\\nnamed images inside a directory named resources, where resources is directly on the class\\npath. Then the path to the ﬁle is “resources/images/cards.p ng” and the command for locating\\nthe resource would be\\nURL imageURL = cl.getResource(\"resources/images/cards.png\");\\nOnce you have a URL that represents the location of a resource ﬁle, you could use a URL-\\nConnection, as discussed in Subsection 11.4.1, to read the contents of t hat ﬁle. However, Java\\nprovides more convenient methods for loading several types of resources. F or loading image\\nresources, a convenient method is available in the class java.awt.Toolkit. It can be used as\\nin the following line from HighLowWithImages, where cardImages is an instance variable of\\ntype Image and imageURL is the URL that represents the location of the image ﬁle:'),\n",

Once you have an\\nAudioClip, you can call its play() method to play the audio clip from the beginning.\\nHere is a method that puts all this together to load and play th e sound from an audio\\nresource ﬁle:\\nprivate void playAudioResource(String audioResourceName) {\\nClassLoader cl = SoundAndCursorDemo.class.getClassLoader();\\nURL resourceURL = cl.getResource(audioResourceName);\\nif (resourceURL != null) {\\nAudioClip sound = JApplet.newAudioClip(resourceURL);\\nsound.play();\\n}\\n}\\nThis method is from a sample program SoundAndCursorDemo that will be discussed in the next\\nsubsection. Of course, if you plan to reuse the sound often, i t would be better to load the sound\\nonce into an instance variable of type AudioClip, which could then be used to play the sound\\nany number of times, without the need to reload it each time.\\nThe AudioClip class supports audio ﬁles in the common W A V, AIFF, and AU form ats.\\n12.1.4 Cursors and Icons\\nThe position of the mouse is represented on the computer’s sc reen by a small image called a\\ncursor . In Java, the cursor is represented by an object of type java.awt.Cursor. A Cursor\\nhas an associated image. It also has a hot spot , which is a Point that speciﬁes the pixel within\\nthe image that corresponds to the exact point on the screen wh ere the mouse is pointing. F or\\nexample, for a typical “arrow” cursor, the hot spot is the tip of the arrow. F or a “crosshair”\\ncursor, the hot spot is the center of the crosshairs.\\nThe Cursor class deﬁnes several standard cursors, which are identiﬁed by constants such\\nas Cursor.CROSSHAIR\\nCURSOR and Cursor.DEFAULT CURSOR. Y ou can get a standard cursor by\\ncalling the static method Cursor.getPredefinedCursor(code), where code is one of the\\nconstants that identify the standard cursors. It is also pos sible to create a custom cursor from\\nan Image. The Image might be obtained as an image resource, as described in the pr evious'),\n",

When the mouse m oves over a component,\\nthe cursor changes to whatever Cursor is associated with that component. T o associate a Cursor\\nwith a component, call the component’s instance method setCursor(cursor). F or example,\\nto set the cursor for a JPanel, panel, to be the standard “wait” cursor:\\npanel.setCursor( Cursor.getPredefinedCursor(Cursor.WAIT CURSOR) );\\nT o reset the cursor to be the default cursor, you can use:\\npanel.setCursor( Curser.getDefaultCursor() );\\nT o set the cursor to be an image that is deﬁned in an image resou rce ﬁle named imageResource,\\nyou might use:\\nClassLoader cl = SoundAndCursorDemo.class.getClassLoader();\\nURL resourceURL = cl.getResource(imageResource);\\nif (resourceURL != null) {\\nToolkit toolkit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();\\nImage image = toolkit.createImage(resourceURL);\\nPoint hotSpot = new Point(7,7);\\nCursor cursor = toolkit.createCustomCursor(image, hotSpot, \"mycursor\");\\npanel.setCursor(cursor);\\n}\\nThe sample program SoundAndCursorDemo.java shows how to use predeﬁned and custom\\ncursors and how to play sounds from resource ﬁles. The progra m has several buttons that you\\ncan click. Some of the buttons change the cursor that is assoc iated with the main panel of the\\nprogram. Some of the buttons play sounds. When you play a soun d, the cursor is reset to be\\nthe default cursor. Y ou can ﬁnd an applet version of the progr am in the on-line version of this\\nsection.\\nAnother standard use of images in GUI interfaces is for icons. An icon is simply a small\\npicture. As we’ll see in Section 12.3, icons can be used on Jav a’s buttons, menu items, and\\nlabels; in fact, for our purposes, an icon is simply an image t hat can be used in this way .\\nAn icon is represented by an object of type Icon, which is actually an interface rather than\\na class. The class ImageIcon, which implements the Icon interface, is used to create icons from\\nImages. If image is a (rather small) Image, then the constructor call new ImageIcon(image)\\ncreates an ImageIcon whose picture is the speciﬁed image. Often, the image comes f rom a\\nresource ﬁle.

(See Exercise 12.1.)\\nThere are many ways that the data for an image could be stored i n a ﬁle. Many standard\\nformats have been created for doing this. Java supports at le ast three standard image formats:\\nPNG, JPEG, and GIF. (Individual implementations of Java mig ht support more.) The JPEG\\nformat is “lossy ,” which means that the picture that you get w hen you read a JPEG ﬁle is\\nonly an approximation of the picture that was saved. Some inf ormation in the picture has been\\nlost. Allowing some information to be lost makes it possible to compress the image into a lot\\nfewer bits than would otherwise be necessary . Usually , the a pproximation is quite good. It\\nworks best for photographic images and worst for simple line drawings. The PNG format, on\\nthe other hand is “lossless,” meaning that the picture in the ﬁle is an exact duplicate of the\\npicture that was saved. A PNG ﬁle is compressed, but not in a wa y that loses information. The\\ncompression works best for images made up mostly of large blo cks of uniform color; it works\\nworst for photographic images. GIF is an older format that is limited to just 256 colors in an\\nimage; it has mostly been superseded by PNG.\\nSuppose that image is a BuﬀeredImage . The image can be saved to a ﬁle simply by calling\\nImageIO.write( image, format, file )\\nwhere format is a String that speciﬁes the image format of the ﬁle and file is a File that\\nspeciﬁes the ﬁle that is to be written. (See Subsection 11.2. 2 for information about the File\\nclass.) The format string should ordinarily be either \"PNG\" or \"JPEG\", although other formats\\nmight be supported.\\nImageIO.write() is a static method in the ImageIO class. It returns a boolean value\\nthat is false if the image format is not supported. That is, if the speciﬁed image format is\\nnot supported, then the image is not saved, but no exception is thrown. This means that you\\nshould always check the return value! F or example:\\nboolean hasFormat = ImageIO.write(OSC,format,selectedFile);\\nif ( ! hasFormat )\\nthrow new Exception(format + \" format is not available.\");\\nIf the image format is recognized, it is still possible that an IOExcption might be thrown when\\nthe attempt is made to send the data to the ﬁle.\\nUsually , the ﬁle to be used in ImageIO.write() will be selected by the user using a JFile-\\nChooser, as discussed in Subsection 11.2.3. F or example, here is a ty pical method for saving an\\nimage:\\n/**\\n* Attempts to save an image to a file selected by the user.\\n* @param image the BufferedImage to be saved to the file\\n* @param format the format of the image, probably either \"PNG\" or \"JPEG\"\\n*/\\nprivate void doSaveFile(BufferedImage image, String format) {\\nif (fileDialog == null)\\nfileDialog = new JFileChooser();\\nfileDialog.setSelectedFile(new File(\"image.\" + format.toLowerCase()));\\nfileDialog.setDialogTitle(\"Select File to be Saved\");\\nint option = fileDialog.showSaveDialog(null);\\nif (option != JFileChooser.APPROVE\\nOPTION)\\nreturn; // User canceled or clicked the dialog’s close box.\\nFile selectedFile = fileDialog.getSelectedFile();'),\n",

The method\\nImageIO.read( inputFile )\\ntakes a variable of type File as a parameter and returns a BuﬀeredImage . The return value\\nis null if the ﬁle does not contain an image that is stored in a support ed format. Again, no\\nexception is thrown in this case, so you should always be care ful to check the return value. It\\nis also possible for an IOException to occur when the attempt is made to read the ﬁle. There\\nis another version of the read() method that takes an InputStream instead of a ﬁle as its\\nparameter, and a third version that takes a URL.\\nEarlier in this section, we encountered another method for r eading an image from a URL,\\nthe createImage() method from the T oolkit class. The diﬀerence is that ImageIO.read()\\nreads the image data completely and stores the result in a BuﬀeredImage . On the other hand,\\ncreateImage() does not actually read the data; it really just stores the ima ge location and\\nthe data won’t be read until later, when the image is used. Thi s has the advantage that the\\ncreateImage() method itself can complete very quickly . ImageIO.read(), on the other hand,\\ncan take some time to execute.\\n12.2 Fancier Graphics\\nThe graphics commands provided by the Graphics class are suﬃcient for many purposes.\\nHowever, recent versions of Java provide a much larger and ri cher graphical toolbox in the form\\nof the class java.awt.Graphics2D. I mentioned Graphics2D in Subsection 6.3.5 and promised\\nto discuss it further in this chapter.\\nGraphics2D is a subclass of Graphics, so all of the graphics commands that you already\\nknow can be used with a Graphics2D object. In fact, when you obtain a Graphics context for\\ndrawing on a Swing component or on a BuﬀeredImage , the graphics object is actually of type\\nGraphics2D and can be type-cast to gain access to the advanced Graphics2D graphics commands.'),\n",

F ANCIER GRAPHICS 625\\nF or example, if image is of type BuﬀeredImage , then you can get a Graphics2D for drawing on\\nthe image using:\\nGraphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)image.getGraphics();\\nAnd, as mentioned in Subsection 6.3.5, to use Graphics2D commands in the paintComponent()\\nmethod of a Swing component, you can write a paintComponent() method of the form:\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\\nsuper.paintComponent(g);\\nGraphics g2 = (Graphics2D)g;\\n.\\n. // Draw to the component using g2 (and g).\\n.\\n}\\nNote that when you do this, g and g2 are just two variables that refer to the same object,\\nso they both draw to the same drawing surface; g2 just gives you access to methods that are\\ndeﬁned in Graphics2D but not in Graphics. When properties of g2, such as drawing color, are\\nchanged, the changes also apply to g. By saying\\nGraphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g.create()\\nyou can obtain a newly created graphics context. The object c reated by g.create() is a\\ngraphics context that draws to the same drawing surface as g and that initially has all the\\nsame properties as g. However, it is a separate object, so that changing properti es in g2 has no\\neﬀect on g. This can be useful if you want to keep an unmodiﬁed copy of the original graphics\\ncontext around for some drawing operations.\\n12.2.1 Measuring T ext\\nAlthough this section is mostly about Graphics2D, we start with a topic that has nothing to do\\nwith it.\\nOften, when drawing a string, it’s important to know how big t he image of the string will\\nbe. F or example, you need this information if you want to cent er a string in a component. Or\\nif you want to know how much space to leave between two lines of text, when you draw them\\none above the other. Or if the user is typing the string and you want to position a cursor at the\\nend of the string. In Java, questions about the size of a strin g can be answered by an object\\nbelonging to the standard class java.awt.FontMetrics.\\nThere are several lengths associated with any given font. So me of them are shown in this\\nillustration:\\nA s c e n t\\nD e s c e n t\\nL e a d i n g\\nL i n e h e i g h t'),\n",

ADV ANCED GUI PROGRAMMING\\nThe dashed lines in the illustration are the baselines of the two lines of text. The baseline\\nof a string is the line on which the bases of the characters res t. The suggested distance between\\ntwo baselines, for single-spaced text, is known as the lineheight of the font. The ascent is\\nthe distance that tall characters can rise above the baselin e, and the descent is the distance\\nthat tails like the one on the letter “g” can descend below the baseline. The ascent and descent\\ndo not add up to the lineheight, because there should be some e xtra space between the tops of\\ncharacters in one line and the tails of characters on the line above. The extra space is called\\nleading. (The term comes from the time when lead blocks were used for p rinting. Characters\\nwere formed on blocks of lead that were lined up to make up the t ext of a page, covered with\\nink, and pressed onto paper to print the page. Extra, blank “l eading” was used to separate the\\nlines of characters.) All these quantities can be determine d by calling instance methods in a\\nFontMetrics object. There are also methods for determining the width of a character and the\\ntotal width of a string of characters.\\nRecall that a font in Java is represented by the class Font. A FontMetrics object is asso-\\nciated with a given font and is used to measure characters and strings in that font. If font\\nis of type Font and g is a graphics context, you can get a FontMetrics object for the font by\\ncalling g.getFontMetrics(font). Then, if fm is the variable that refers to the FontMetrics\\nobject, then the ascent, descent, leading, and lineheight o f the font can be obtained by calling\\nfm.getAscent(), fm.getDescent(), fm.getLeading(), and fm.getHeight(). If ch is a char-\\nacter, then fm.charWidth(ch) is the width of the character when it is drawn in that font. If\\nstr is a string, then fm.stringWidth(str) is the width of the string when drawn in that font.\\nF or example, here is a paintComponent() method that shows the message “Hello W orld” in\\nthe exact center of the component:\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\\nsuper.paintComponent(g);\\nint strWidth, strHeight; // Width and height of the string.\\nint centerX, centerY; // Coordinates of the center of the com ponent.\\nint baseX, baseY; // Coordinates of the basepoint of the stri ng.\\nint topOfString; // y-coordinate of the top of the string.\\ncenterX = getWidth() / 2;\\ncenterY = getHeight() / 2;\\nFont font = g.getFont(); // What font will g draw in?\\nFontMetrics fm = g.getFontMetrics(font);\\nstrWidth = fm.stringWidth(\"Hello World\");\\nstrHeight = fm.getAscent(); // Note: There are no tails on\\n// any of the chars in the string!\\nbaseX = centerX - (strWidth/2); // Move back from center by ha lf the\\n// width of the string.\\ntopOfString = centerY - (strHeight/2); // Move up from cente r by half\\n// the height of the string.\\nbaseY = topOfString + fm.getAscent(); // Baseline is fm.get Ascent() pixels\\n// below the top of the string.\\ng.drawString(\"Hello World\", baseX, baseY); // Draw the string.\\n}'),\n",

If I were drawing “Goodbye\\nW orld” instead of “Hello W orld,” I would have used fm.getAscent() + fm.getDescent(),\\nwhere the descent is added to the height in order to take into a ccount the tail on the “y” in\\n“Goodbye”. The value of baseX is computed to be the amount of space between the left edge\\nof the component and the start of the string. It is obtained by subtracting half the width of the\\nstring from the horizontal center of the component. This wil l center the string horizontally in\\nthe component. The next line computes the position of the top of the string in the same way .\\nHowever, to draw the string, we need the y-coordinate of the b aseline, not the y-coordinate of\\nthe top of the string. The baseline of the string is below the t op of the string by an amount\\nequal to the ascent of the font.\\nThere is an example of centering a two-line block of text in th e sample program Transparen-\\ncyDemo.java, which is discussed in the next subsection.\\n12.2.2 T ransparency\\nA color is represented by red, blue, and green components. In Java’s usual representation, each\\ncomponent is an eight-bit number in the range 0 to 255. The thr ee color components can be\\npacked into a 32-bit integer, but that only accounts for 24 bi ts in the integer. What about the\\nother eight bits? They don’t have to be wasted. They can be use d as a fourth component of\\nthe color, the alpha component . The alpha component can be used in several ways, but it\\nis most commonly associated with transparency. When you draw with a transparent color,\\nit’s like laying down a sheet of colored glass. It doesn’t com pletely obscure the part of the\\nimage that is colored over. Instead, the background image is blended with the transparent\\ncolor that is used for drawing—as if you were looking at the ba ckground through colored glass.\\nThis type of drawing is properly referred to as alpha blending , and it is not equivalent to true\\ntransparency; nevertheless, most people refer to it as tran sparency .\\nThe value of the alpha component determines how transparent that color is. Actually , the\\nalpha component gives the opaqueness of the color. Opaqueness is the opposite of trans-\\nparency . If something is fully opaque, you can’t see through it at all; if something is almost\\nfully opaque, then it is just a little transparent; and so on. When the alpha component of a\\ncolor has the maximum possible value, the color is fully opaq ue. When you draw with a fully\\nopaque color, that color simply replaces the color of the bac kground over which you draw. This\\nis the only type of color that we have used up until now. If the a lpha component of a color is\\nzero, then the color is perfectly transparent, and drawing w ith that color has no eﬀect at all.\\nIntermediate values of the alpha component give partially o paque colors that will blend with\\nthe background when they are used for drawing.\\nThe sample program TransparencyDemo.java can help you to understand transparency .\\nWhen you run the program you will see a display area containin g a triangle, an oval, a rect-\\nangle, and some text. Sliders at the bottom of the applet allo w you to control the degree of\\ntransparency of each shape. When a slider is moved all the way to the right, the corresponding\\nshape is fully opaque; all the way to the left, and the shape is fully transparent. An applet\\nversion of the program can be found in the on-line version of t his section.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nColors with alpha components were introduced in Java along w ith Graphics2D, but they can\\nbe used with ordinary Graphics objects as well. T o specify the alpha component of a color, yo u\\ncan create the Color object using one of the following constructors from the Color class:'),\n",

In the second,\\nthe parameters must be in the range 0.0 to 1.0. F or example,\\nColor transparentRed = new Color( 255, 0, 0, 200 );\\nmakes a slightly transparent red, while\\nColor tranparentCyan = new Color( 0.0F, 1.0F, 1.0F, 0.5F);\\nmakes a blue-green color that is 50% opaque. (The advantage o f the constructor that takes\\nparameters of type ﬂoat is that it lets you think in terms of percentages.) When you cr eate an\\nordinary RGB color, as in new Color(255,0,0), you just get a fully opaque color.\\nOnce you have a transparent color, you can use it in the same wa y as any other color. That\\nis, it if want to use a Color c to draw in a graphics context g, you just say g.setColor(c), and\\nsubsequent drawing operations will use that color. As you ca n see, transparent colors are very\\neasy to use.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nA BuﬀeredImage with image type BufferedImage.TYPE\\nINT ARGB can use transparency .\\nThe color of each pixel in the image can have its own alpha comp onent, which tells how\\ntransparent that pixel will be when the image is drawn over so me background. A pixel whose\\nalpha component is zero is perfectly transparent, and has no eﬀect at all when the image is\\ndrawn; in eﬀect, it’s not part of the image at all. It is also po ssible for pixels to be partly\\ntransparent. When an image is saved to a ﬁle, information abo ut transparency might be lost,\\ndepending on the ﬁle format. The PNG image format supports tr ansparency; JPEG does not.\\n(If you look at the images of playing cards that are used in the program HighLowWithImages in\\nSubsection 12.1.1, you might notice that the tips of the corn ers of the cards are fully transparent.\\nThe card images are from a PNG ﬁle, cards.png.)\\nIf you want to experiment with transparency in BuﬀeredImages , I suggest that you start by\\nmaking the entire canvas fully transparent, before you draw anything else on the canvas. Here\\nis one way of doing this: The Graphics2D class has a method setBackground() that can be\\nused to set a background color for the graphics context, and i t has a clearRect() method that\\nﬁlls a rectangle with the current background color. T o creat e a fully transparent image with\\nwidth w and height h, you can use:\\nBufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(w, h, BufferedImage.TYPE INT ARGB);\\nGraphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)image.getGraphics();\\ng2.setBackground(new Color(0,0,0,0)); // (The R, G, and B v alues don’t matter.)\\ng2.clearRect(0, 0, w, h);\\nAs an example, just for fun, here is a method that will set the c ursor of a component to be a\\nred square with a transparent interior:\\nprivate void useRedSquareCursor() {\\nBufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(24,24,BufferedImage.TYPE\\nINT ARGB);\\nGraphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)image.getGraphics();\\ng2.setBackground(new Color(0,0,0,0));\\ng2.clearRect(0, 0, 24, 24);\\ng2.setColor(Color.RED);\\ng2.drawRect(0,0,23,23);\\ng2.drawRect(1,1,21,21);'),\n",

Actually , there is a problem with this. P ixels are little squares. Geometric\\nﬁgures, on the other hand, are made of geometric points that h ave no size at all. Think about\\ndrawing a circle, and think about a pixel on the boundary of th at circle. The inﬁnitely thin\\ngeometric boundary of the circle cuts through the pixel. Par t of the pixel lies inside the circle,\\npart lies outside. So, when we are ﬁlling the circle with colo r, do we color that pixel or not?\\nA possible solution is to color the pixel if the geometric cir cle covers 50% or more of the pixel.\\nF ollowing this procedure, however, leads to a visual defect known as aliasing. It is visible in\\nimages as a jaggedness or “staircasing” eﬀect along the bord ers of shapes. Lines that are not\\nhorizontal or vertical also have a jagged, aliased appearan ce. (The term “aliasing” seems to\\nrefer to the fact that many diﬀerent geometric points map to t he same pixel. If you think of\\nthe real-number coordinates of a geometric point as a “name” for the pixel that contains that\\npoint, then each pixel has many diﬀerent names or “aliases.” )\\nIt’s not possible to build a circle out of squares, but there i s a technique that can eliminate\\nsome of the jaggedness of aliased images. The technique is ca lled antialiasing. Antialiasing is\\nbased on transparency . The idea is simple: If 50% of a pixel is covered by the geometric ﬁgure\\nthat you are trying to draw, then color that pixel with a color that is 50% transparent. If 25%\\nof the pixel is covered, use a color that is 75% transparent (2 5% opaque). If the entire pixel\\nis covered by the ﬁgure, of course, use a color that is 100% opa que—antialiasing only aﬀects\\npixels along the boundary of the shape.\\nIn antialiasing, the color that you are drawing with is blend ed with the original color of the\\npixel, and the amount of blending depends on the fraction of t he pixel that is covered by the\\ngeometric shape. (The fraction is diﬃcult to compute exactl y , so in practice, various methods\\nare used to approximate it.) Of course, you still don’t get a p icture of the exact geometric\\nshape, but antialiased images do tend to look better than jag ged, aliased images.\\nF or an example, look at the image in the next subsection. Anti aliasing is used to draw\\nthe panels in the second and third row of the image, but it is no t used in the top row. Y ou\\nshould note the jagged appearance of the lines and rectangle s in the top row. (By the way ,\\nwhen antialiasing is applied to a line, the line is treated as a geometric rectangle whose width\\nis equal to the size of one pixel.)\\nAntialiasing is supported in Graphics2D. By default, antialiasing is turned oﬀ. If g2 is a\\ngraphics context of type Graphics2D, you can turn on antialiasing in g2 by saying:\\ng2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY\\nANTIALIASING,\\nRenderingHints.VALUE ANTIALIAS ON);\\nAs you can see, this is only a “hint” that you would like to use a ntialiasing, and it is even\\npossible that the hint will be ignored. However, it is likely that subsequent drawing operations\\nin g2 will be antialiased. If you want to turn antialiasing oﬀ in g2, you can just say:'),\n",

Y ou can draw\\nlines of any thickness, and you can draw lines that are dotted or dashed instead of solid.\\nAn object of type Stroke contains information about how lines should be drawn, inclu ding\\nhow thick the line should be and what pattern of dashes and dot s, if any , should be used. Every\\nGraphics2D has an associated Stroke object. The default Stroke draws a solid line of thickness\\none. T o get lines with diﬀerent properties, you just have to i nstall a diﬀerent stroke into the\\ngraphics context.\\nStroke is an interface, not a class. The class BasicStroke, which implements the Stroke\\ninterface, is the one that is actually used to create stroke o bjects. F or example, to create a\\nstroke that draws solid lines with thickness equal to 3, use:\\nBasicStroke line3 = new BasicStroke(3);\\nIf g2 is of type Graphics2D, the stroke can be installed in g2 by calling its setStroke() com-\\nmand:\\ng2.setStroke(line3)\\nAfter calling this method, subsequent drawing operations w ill use lines that are three times as\\nwide as the usual thickness. The thickness of a line can be giv en by a value of type ﬂoat , not\\njust by an int. F or example, to use lines of thickness 2.5 in the graphics co ntext g2, you can\\nsay:\\ng2.setStroke( new BasicStroke(2.5F) );\\n(F ractional widths make more sense if antialiasing is turne d on.)\\nWhen you have a thick line, the question comes up, what to do at the ends of the line. If\\nyou draw a physical line with a large, round piece of chalk, th e ends of the line will be rounded.\\nWhen you draw a line on the computer screen, should the ends be rounded, or should the line\\nsimply be cut oﬀ ﬂat? With the BasicStroke class, the choice is up to you. Maybe it’s time\\nto look at examples. This illustration shows ﬁfteen lines, d rawn using diﬀerent BasicStrokes.\\nLines in the middle row have rounded ends; lines in the other t wo rows are simpley cut oﬀ\\nat their endpoints. Lines of various thicknesses are shown, and the bottom row shows dashed\\nlines. (And, as mentioned above, only the bottom two rows are antialiased.)'),\n",

In thi s program, you can click and drag\\nin any of the small panels, and the lines in all the panels will be redrawn as you move the\\nmouse. In addition, if you right-click and drag, then rectan gles will be drawn instead of lines;\\nthis shows that strokes are used for drawing the outlines of s hapes and not just for straight\\nlines. If you look at the corners of the rectangles that are dr awn by the program, you’ll see\\nthat there are several ways of drawing a corner where two wide line segments meet.\\nAll the options that you want for a BasicStroke have to be speciﬁed in the constructor. Once\\nthe stroke object is created, there is no way to change the opt ions. There is one constructor\\nthat lets you specify all possible options:\\npublic BasicStroke( float width, int capType, int joinType, float miterlimit,\\nfloat[] dashPattern, float dashPhase )\\nI don’t want to cover all the options in detail, but here’s som e basic info:\\n• width speciﬁes the thickness of the line\\n• capType speciﬁes how the ends of a line are “capped.” The possible val ues are\\nBasicStroke.CAP SQUARE, BasicStroke.CAP ROUND and BasicStroke.CAP BUTT.

Use 0 for this parameter in most cases.\\nF or the third row in the above picture, the dashPattern is set to new float[] {5,5}. This\\nmeans that the lines are drawn starting with a solid segment o f length 5, followed by a transpar-\\nent section of length 5, and then repeating the same pattern. A simple dotted line would have\\nthickness 1 and dashPattern new float[] {1,1}. A pattern of short and long dashes could be\\nmade by using new float[] {10,4,4,4}. F or more information, see the Java documentation,\\nor try experimenting with the source code for the sample prog ram.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nSo now we can draw fancier lines. But any drawing operation is still restricted to drawing\\nwith a single color. W e can get around that restriction by usi ng Paint. An object of type Paint\\nis used to assign color to each pixel that is “hit” by a drawing operation. Paint is an interface,\\nand the Color class implements the Paint interface. When a color is used for painting, it applies\\nthe same color to every pixel that is hit. However, there are o ther types of paint where the color\\nthat is applied to a pixel depends on the coordinates of that p ixel. Standard Java includes two\\nclasses that deﬁne paint with this property: GradientPaint and T exturePaint. In a gradient, the\\ncolor that is applied to pixels changes gradually from one co lor to a second color as you move\\nin a certain direction. In a texture, the pixel colors come from an image, which is repeated, if\\nnecessary , like a wallpaper pattern to cover the entire xy-p lane.\\nIt will be helpful to look at some examples. This illustratio n shows a polygon ﬁlled with\\ntwo diﬀerent textures. The polygon on the left uses a GradientPaint while the one on the right\\nuses a T exturePaint. Note that in this picture, the paint is used only for ﬁlling t he polygon.\\nThe outline of the polygon is drawn in a plain black color. How ever, Paint objects can be used\\nfor drawing lines as well as for ﬁlling shapes. These picture s were made by the sample program\\nPaintDemo.java. In that program, you can select among several diﬀerent pain ts, and you can\\ncontrol certain properties of the paints. As usual, an apple t version of the program is available\\non line.\\nGradient paints are created using the constructor\\npublic GradientPaint(float x1, float y1, Color c1,\\nfloat x2, float y2, Color c2, boolean cyclic)'),\n",

As you move along the line between the two points, the color o f the\\ngradient changes from c1 to c2; along lines perpendicular to this line, the color is consta nt.\\nThe last parameter, cyclic, tells what happens if you move past the point (x2,y2) on the\\nline from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). If cyclic is false, the color stops changing and any point\\nbeyond (x2,y2) has color c2. If cyclic is true, then the colors continue to change in a cyclic\\npattern after you move past (x2,y2). (It works the same way if you move past the other\\nendpoint, (x1,y1).) In most cases, you will set cyclic to true. Note that you can vary the\\npoints (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) to change the width and direction of the gradient. F or exampl e,\\nto create a cyclic gradient that varies from black to light gr ay along the line from (0,0) to\\n(100,100), use:\\nnew GradientPaint( 0, 0, Color.BLACK, 100, 100, Color.LIGHT GRAY, true)\\nT o construct a T exturePaint, you need a BuﬀeredImage that contains the image that will be\\nused for the texture. Y ou also specify a rectangle in which th e image will be drawn. The image\\nwill be scaled, if necessary , to exactly ﬁll the rectangle. O utside the speciﬁed rectangle, the\\nimage will be repeated horizontally and vertically to ﬁll th e plane. Y ou can vary the size and\\nposition of the rectangle to change the scale of the texture a nd its positioning on the plane.\\nOrdinarily , however the upper left corner of the rectangle i s placed at (0,0), and the size of\\nthe rectangle is the same as the actual size of the image. The c onstructor for T exturePaint is\\ndeﬁned as\\npublic TexturePaint( BufferedImage textureImage, Rectangle2D anchorRect)\\nThe Rectangle2D is part of the Graphics2D framework and will be discussed at the end of this\\nsection. Oftern, a call to the constructor takes the form:\\nnew TexturePaint( image,\\nnew Rectangle2D.Double(0,0,image.getWidth(),image.getHeight() )\\nOnce you have a Paint object, you can use the setPaint() method of a Graphics2D object\\nto install the paint in a graphics context. F or example, if g2 is of type Graphics2D, then the\\ncommand\\ng2.setPaint( new GradientPaint(0,0,Color.BLUE,100,100,Color.GREEN,true) );\\nsets up g2 to use a gradient paint. Subsequent drawing operations with g2 will draw using a\\nblue/green gradient.\\n12.2.5 T ransforms\\nIn the standard drawing coordinates on a component, the uppe r left corner of the component\\nhas coordinates (0,0). Coordinates are integers, and the coordinates (x,y) refer to the point\\nthat is x pixels over from the left edge of the component and y pixels down from the top. With\\nGraphics2D, however, you are not restricted to using these coordinates . In fact, you can can\\nset up a Graphics2D graphics context to use any system of coordinates that you li ke. Y ou can\\nuse this capability to select the coordinate system that is m ost appropriate for the things that\\nyou want to draw. F or example, if you are drawing architectur al blueprints, you might use\\ncoordinates in which one unit represents an actual distance of one foot.\\nChanges to a coordinate system are referred to as transforms. There are three basic\\ntypes of transform. A translate transform changes the position of the origin, (0,0). A scale\\ntransform changes the scale, that is, the unit of distance. A nd a rotation transforms applies a'),\n",

ADV ANCED GUI PROGRAMMING\\nrotation about some point. Y ou can make more complex transfo rms by combining transforms\\nof the three basic types. F or example, you can apply a rotatio n, followed by a scale, followed by\\na translation, followed by another rotation. When you apply several transforms in a row, their\\neﬀects are cumulative. It takes a fair amount of study to full y understand complex transforms.\\nI will limit myself here to discussing a few of the most simple cases, just to give you an idea of\\nwhat transforms can do\\nSuppose that g2 is of type Graphics2D. Then g2.translate(x,y) moves the origin,\\n(0,0), to the point (x,y). This means that if you use coordinates (0,0) after saying\\ng2.translate(x,y), then you are referring to the point that used to be (x,y), before the\\ntranslation was applied. All other coordinate pairs are mov ed by the same amount. F or exam-\\nple saying\\ng.translate(x,y);\\ng.drawLine( 0, 0, 100, 200 );\\ndraws the same line as\\ng.drawLine( x, y, 100+x, 200+y );\\nIn the second case, you are just doing the same translation “b y hand.” A translation (like all\\ntransforms) aﬀects all subsequent drawing operations. Ins tead of thinking in terms of coordinate\\nsystems, you might ﬁnd it clearer to think of what happens to t he objects that are drawn. After\\nyou say g2.translate(x,y), any objects that you draw are displaced x units vertically and y\\nunits horizontally . Note that the parameters x and y can be real numbers.\\nAs an example, perhaps you would prefer to have (0,0) at the center of a component, instead\\nof at its upper left corner. T o do this, just use the following command in the paintComponent()\\nmethod of the component:\\ng2.translate( getWidth()/2, getHeight()/2 );\\nT o apply a scale transform to a Graphics2D g2, use g2.scale(s,s), where s is the real\\nnumber that speciﬁes the scaling factor. If s is greater than 1, everything is magniﬁed by a\\nfactor of s, while if s is between 0 and 1, everything is shrunk by a factor of s. The center of\\nscaling is (0,0). That is, the point (0,0) is unaﬀected by the scaling, and other points more\\ntowards or away from (0,0) by a factor of s. Again, it can be clearer to think of the eﬀect\\non objects that are drawn after a scale transform is applied. Those objects will be magniﬁed\\nor shrunk by a factor of s. Note that scaling aﬀects everything, including thickness of lines\\nand size of fonts. By the way , it is possible to use scale facto rs that are less than 0. It is even\\npossible to use diﬀerent scale factors in the horizontal and vertical direction with a command\\nof the form g2.scale(sx,sy), although that will distort the shapes of objects.\\nThe third type of basic transform is rotation. The command g2.rotate(r) rotates all\\nsubsequently drawn objects through an angle of r about the point (0,0). Y ou can rotate\\ninstead about the point (x,y) with the command g2.rotate(r,x,y). All the parameters can\\nbe real numbers. Angles are measured in radians, where one ra dian is equal to 180 degrees. T o\\nrotate through an angle of d degrees, use\\ng2.rotate( d * Math.PI / 180 );\\nPositive angles are clockwise rotations, while negative an gles are counterclockwise (unless you\\nhave already applied a negative scale factor, which reverse s the orientation).\\nRotation is not as common as translation or scaling, but ther e are a few things that you\\ncan do with it that can’t be done any other way . F or example, yo u can use it to draw an image\\n“on the slant.” Rotation also makes it possible to draw text t hat is rotated so that its baseline'),\n",

Graphics2D makes\\nit possible to use real numbers as coordinates. This becomes particularly important once you\\nstart using transforms, since after you apply a scale, a squa re of size one might cover many\\npixels instead of just a single pixel. Unfortunately , the de signers of Java couldn’t decide whether\\nto use numbers of type ﬂoat or double as coordinates, and their indecision makes things a little\\nmore complicated than they need to be. (My guess is that they r eally wanted to use ﬂoat , since\\nvalues of type ﬂoat have enough accuracy for graphics and are probably used in the underlying\\ngraphical computations of the computer. However, in Java pr ogramming, it’s easier to use\\ndouble than ﬂoat , so they wanted to make it possible to use double values too.)\\nT o use real number coordinates, you have to use classes deﬁne d in the package\\njava.awt.geom. Among the classes in this package are classes that represen t geometric shapes\\nsuch as lines and rectangles. F or example, the class Line2D represents a line whose endpoints\\nare given as real number coordinates. The unfortunate thing is that Line2D is an abstract\\nclass, which means that you can’t create objects of type Line2D directly . However, Line2D\\nhas two concrete subclasses that can be used to create object s. One subclass uses coordinates\\nof type ﬂoat , and one uses coordinates of type double. The most peculiar part is that these\\nsubclasses are deﬁned as static nested classes inside Line2D. Their names are Line2D.Float and\\nLine2D.Double. This means that Line2D objects can be created, for example, with:\\nLine2D line1 = new Line2D.Float( 0.17F, 1.3F, -2.7F, 5.21F );\\nLine2D line2 = new Line2D.Double( 0, 0, 1, 0);\\nLine2D line3 = new Line2D.Double( x1, y1, x2, y2 );\\nwhere x1, y1, x2, y2 are any numeric variables. In my own code, I generally use Line2D.Double\\nrather than Line2D.Float.\\nOther shape classes in java.awt.geom are similar. The class that represents rectangles is\\nRectangle2D. T o create a rectangle object, you have to use either Rectangle2D.Float or Rectan-\\ngle2D.Double. F or example,\\nRectangle2D rect = new Rectangle2D.Double( -0.5, -0.5, 1.0, 1.0 );\\ncreates a rectangle with a corner at (-0.5,-0.5) and with width and height both equal to 1.\\nOther classes include Point2D, which represents a single point; Ellipse2D, which represents an\\noval; and Arc2D, which represents an arc of a circle.\\nIf g2 is of type Graphcis2D and shape is an object belonging to one of the 2D shape classes,\\nthen the command\\ng2.draw(shape);'),\n",

But the heart of most graphical user interface programming is using\\nGUI components. In this section and the next, we’ll be lookin g at JComponents. W e’ll cover\\nseveral component classes that were not covered in Chapter 6 , as well as some features of classes\\nthat were covered there.\\nThis section is mostly about buttons. Buttons are among the s implest of GUI components,\\nand it seems like there shouldn’t be all that much to say about them. However, buttons are\\nnot as simple as they seem. F or one thing, there are many diﬀer ent types of buttons. The\\nbasic functionality of buttons in Java is deﬁned by the class javax.swing.AbstractButton.\\nSubclasses of this class represent push buttons, check boxe s, and radio buttons. Menu items\\nare also considered to be buttons. The AbstractButton class deﬁnes a surprisingly large API for\\ncontrolling the appearance of buttons. This section will co ver part of that API, but you should\\nsee the class documentation for full details.\\nIn this section, we’ll also encounter a few classes that do no t themselves deﬁne buttons but\\nthat are related to the button API, starting with “actions.”\\n12.3.1 Action and AbstractAction\\nThe JButton class represents push buttons. Up until now, we have created push buttons using\\nthe constructor\\npublic JButton(String text);\\nwhich speciﬁes text that will appear on the button. W e then ad ded an ActionListener to the\\nbutton, to respond when the user presses it. Another way to cr eate a JButton is using an\\nAction. The Action interface represents the general idea of some action that ca n be performed,\\ntogether with properties associated with that action, such as a name for the action, an icon\\nthat represents the action, and whether the action is curren tly enabled or disabled. Actions are\\nusually deﬁned using the class AbstractAction, an abstract class which includes a method,\\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)\\nthat must be deﬁned in any concrete subclass. Often, this is d one in an anonymous inner class.\\nF or example, if display is an object that has a clear() method, an Action object that represents\\nthe action “clear the display” might be deﬁned as:'),\n",

F urthermore,\\nwhen you change a property of the action, the corresponding p roperty of the button will also\\nbe changed.\\nThe Action interface deﬁnes a setEnabled() method that is used to enable and\\ndisable the action. The clearAction action can be enabled and disabled by calling\\nclearAction.setEnabled(true) and clearAction.setEnabled(false). When you do this,\\nany button that has been created from the action is also enabl ed or disabled at the same time.\\nNow of course, the question is, why should you want to use Actions at all? One advantage\\nis that using actions can help you to organize your code bette r. Y ou can create separate objects\\nthat represent each of the actions that can be performed in yo ur program. This represents a nice\\ndivision of responsibility . Of course, you could do the same thing with individual ActionListener\\nobjects, but then you couldn’t associate descriptions and o ther properties with the actions.\\nMore important is the fact that Actions can also be used in other places in the Java API.\\nY ou can use an Action to create a JMenuItem in the same way as for a JButton:\\nJMenuItem clearCommand = new JMenuItem( clearAction );\\nA JMenuItem, in fact, is a kind of button and shares many of the same proper ties that a JButton\\ncan have. Y ou can use the same Action to create both a button and a menu item (or even\\nseveral of each if you want). Whenever you enable or disable t he action or change its name, the\\nbutton and the menu item will both be changed to match. If you change the NAME property of\\nthe action, the text of both the menu item and the button will b e set to new name of the action.\\nY ou can think of the button and the menu items as being two pres entations of the Action, and\\nyou don’t have to keep track of the button or menu item after yo u create them. Y ou can do\\neverything that you need to do by manipulating the Action object.\\nIt is also possible to associate an Action with any key , so that the action will be performed\\nwhenever the user presses that key . I won’t explain how to do i t here, but you can look up the\\ndocumentation for the classes javax.swing.InputMap and javax.swing.ActionMap.'),\n",

Y ou can add the action object directly to\\nthe menu, and the menu item will be created from the propertie s of the action. F or example, if\\nmenu is a JMenu and clearAction is an Action, you can simply say menu.add(clearAction).\\n12.3.2 Icons on Buttons\\nIn addition to—or instead of—text, buttons can also show ico ns. Icons are represented by the\\nIcon interface and are usually created as ImageIcons, as discussed in Subsection 12.1.4. F or\\nexample, here is a picture of a button that displays an image o f a large “X” as its icon:\\nThe icon for a button can be set by calling the button’s setIcon() method, or by passing the\\nicon object as a parameter to the constructor when the button is created. T o create the button\\nshown above, I created an ImageIcon from a BuﬀeredImage on which I drew the picture that\\nI wanted, and I constructed the JButton using a constructor that takes both the text and the\\nicon for the button as parameters. Here’s the code segment th at does it:\\nBufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(24,24,BufferedImage.TYPE INT RGB);\\nGraphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)image.getGraphics();\\ng2.setColor(Color.LIGHT\\nGRAY); // Draw the image for the icon.\\ng2.fillRect(0,0,24,24);\\ng2.setStroke( new BasicStroke(3) ); // Use thick lines.\\ng2.setColor(Color.BLACK);\\ng2.drawLine(4,4,20,20); // Draw the \"X\".\\ng2.drawLine(4,20,20,4);\\ng2.dispose();\\nIcon clearIcon = new ImageIcon(image); // Create the icon.\\nJButton clearButton = new JButton(\"Clear the Display\", clearIcon);\\nY ou can create a button with an icon but no text by using a const ructor that takes just the\\nicon as parameter. Another alternative is for the button to g et its icon from an Action. When\\na button is constructed from an action, it takes its icon from the value of the action property\\nAction.SMALL\\nICON. F or example, suppose that we want to use an action named clearAction\\nto create the button shown above. This could be done with:\\nclearAction.putValue( Action.SMALL ICON, clearIcon );\\nJButton clearButton = new JButton( clearAction );\\nThe icon could also be associated with the action by passing i t as a parameter to the constructor\\nof an AbstractAction:\\nAction clearAction = new AbstractAction(\"Clear the Display\", clearIcon) {\\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {\\n.\\n. // Carry out the action.\\n.\\n}\\n}\\nJButton clearButton = new JButton( clearAction );'),\n",

ACTIONS AND BUTTONS 639\\nThe appearance of buttons can be tweaked in many ways. F or exa mple, you can change the\\nsize of the gap between the button’s text and its icon. Y ou can associate additional icons with\\na button that are used when the button is in certain states, su ch as when it is pressed or when\\nit is disabled. It is even possible to change the positioning of the text with respect to the icon.\\nF or example, to place the text centered below the icon on a but ton, you can say:\\nbutton.setHorizontalTextPosition(JButton.CENTER);\\nbutton.setVerticalTextPosition(JButton.BOTTOM);\\nThese methods and many others are deﬁned in the class AbstractButton. This class is a su-\\nperclass for JMenuItem, as well as for JButton and for the classes that deﬁne check boxes and\\nradion buttons. Note in particular that an icon can be shown i n a menu by associating the icon\\nwith a menu item or with the action that is used to create the me nu item.\\nFinally , I will mention that it is possible to use icons on JLabels in much the same way that\\nthey can be used on JButtons.\\n12.3.3 Radio Buttons\\nThe JCheckBox class was covered in Subsection 6.6.3, and the equivalent fo r use in menus,\\nJCheckBoxMenuItem, in Subsection 6.8.1. A checkbox has two states, selected an d not selected,\\nand the user can change the state by clicking on the check box. The state of a checkbox can\\nalso be set programmatically by calling its setSelected() method, and the current value of\\nthe state can be checked using the isSelected() method.\\nClosely related to checkboxes are radio buttons . Like a checkbox, a radio button can be\\neither selected or not. However, radio buttons are expected occur in groups, and at most one\\nradio button in a group can be selected at any given time. In Ja va, a radio button is represented\\nby an object of type JRadioButton. When used in isolation, a JRadioButton acts just like a\\nJCheckBox, and it has the same methods and events. Ordinarily , however , a JRadioButton\\nis used in a group. A group of radio buttons is represented by a n object belonging to the\\nclass ButtonGroup. A ButtonGroup is not a component and does not itself have a visible\\nrepresentation on the screen. A ButtonGroup works behind the scenes to organize a group of\\nradio buttons, to ensure that at most one button in the group c an be selected at any given\\ntime.\\nT o use a group of radio buttons, you must create a JRadioButton object for each button\\nin the group, and you must create one object of type ButtonGroup to organize the individual\\nbuttons into a group. Each JRadioButton must be added individually to some container, so that\\nit will appear on the screen. (A ButtonGroup plays no role in the placement of the buttons on\\nthe screen.) Each JRadioButton must also be added to the ButtonGroup, which has an add()\\nmethod for this purpose. If you want one of the buttons to be se lected initially , you can call\\nsetSelected(true) for that button. If you don’t do this, then none of the buttons will be\\nselected until the user clicks on one of them.\\nAs an example, here is how you could set up a set of radio button s that can be used to\\nselect a color:\\nJRadioButton redRadio, blueRadio, greenRadio, blackRadio;\\n// Variables to represent the radio buttons.\\n// These should probably be instance variables, so\\n// that they can be used throughout the program.\\nButtonGroup colorGroup = new ButtonGroup();'),\n",

Just as for checkboxes, it is not always nece ssary\\nto register listeners for radio buttons. In some cases, you c an simply check the state of each\\nbutton when you need to know it, using the button’s isSelected() method.\\nAll this is demonstrated in the sample program RadioButtonDemo.java. The program shows\\nfour radio buttons. When the user selects one of the radio but tons, the text and background\\ncolor of a label is changed. Here is a picture of the program, w ith the “Green” radio button\\nselected:\\nY ou can add the equivalent of a group of radio buttons to a menu by using the class\\nJRadioButtonMenuItem. T o use this class, create several objects of this type, and c reate a But-\\ntonGroup to manage them. Add each JRadioButtonMenuItem to the ButtonGroup, and also add\\nthem to a JMenu. If you want one of the items to be selected initially , call it s setSelected()\\nmethod to set its selection state to true. Y ou can add ActionListeners to each JRadioButton-\\nMenuItem if you need to take some action when the user selects the menu i tem; if not, you\\ncan simply check the selected states of the buttons whenever you need to know them. As an\\nexample, suppose that menu is a JMenu. Then you can add a group of buttons to menu as\\nfollows:\\nJRadionButtonMenuItem selectRedItem, selectGreenItem, selectBlueItem;\\n// These might be defined as instance variables\\nButtonGroup group = new ButtonGroup();\\nselectRedItem = new JRadioButtonMenuItem(\"Red\");\\ngroup.add(selectRedItem);\\nmenu.add(selectRedItem);'),\n",

Y ou can change the\\nappearance of the check box by substituting diﬀerent icons f or the standard ones.\\nThe icon that is shown when the check box is unselected is just the main icon for the\\nJCheckBox.

This means that\\nyou can’t check or set the selection state through the action . In Java 6.0, the action API will\\nbe considerably improved, and among the changes is support f or selection state.\\n12.3.4 T oolbars\\nIt has become increasingly common for programs to have a row o f small buttons along the top\\nor side of the program window that oﬀer access to some of the co mmonly used features of the\\nprogram. The row of buttons is known as a tool bar . Typically , the buttons in a tool bar are\\npresented as small icons, with no text. T ool bars can also con tain other components, such as\\nJT extFields and JLabels.\\nIn Swing, tool bars are represented by the class JT oolBar. A JT oolBar is a container that can\\nhold other components. It is also itself a component, and so c an be added to other containers.\\nIn general, the parent component of the tool bar should use a BorderLayout. The tool bar\\nshould occupy one of the edge positions— NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST—in the BorderLayout.\\nF urthermore, the other three edge positions should be empty . The reason for this is that it\\nmight be possible (depending on the platform and conﬁgurati on) for the user to drag the tool\\nbar from one edge position in the parent container to another . It might even be possible for\\nthe user to drag the toolbar oﬀ its parent entirely , so that it becomes a separate window.\\nHere is a picture of a tool bar from the sample program ToolBarDemo.java.'),\n",

The ﬁrst three\\nbuttons in the tool bar are a set of radio buttons that control the drawing color. The fourth\\nbutton is a push button that the user can click to clear the dra wing.\\nT ool bars are easy to use. Y ou just have to create the JT oolBar object, add it to a container,\\nand add some buttons and possibly other components to the too l bar. One ﬁne point is adding\\nspace to a tool bar, such as the gap between the radio buttons a nd the push button in the\\nsample program. Y ou can leave a gap by adding a separator to th e tool bar. F or example:\\ntoolbar.addSeparator(new Dimension(20,20));\\nThis adds an invisible 20-by-20 pixel block to the tool bar. T his will appear as a 20 pixel gap\\nbetween components.\\nHere is the constructor from the ToolBarDemo program. It shows how to create the tool\\nbar and place it in a container. Note that class T oolBarDemo is a subclass of JPanel, and the\\ntool bar and display are added to the panel object that is bein g constructed:\\npublic ToolBarDemo() {\\nsetLayout(new BorderLayout(2,2));\\nsetBackground(Color.GRAY);\\nsetBorder(BorderFactory.createLineBorder(Color.GRAY,2));\\ndisplay = new Display();\\nadd(display, BorderLayout.CENTER);\\nJToolBar toolbar = new JToolBar();\\nadd(toolbar, BorderLayout.NORTH);\\nButtonGroup group = new ButtonGroup();\\ntoolbar.add( makeColorRadioButton(Color.RED,group,true) );\\ntoolbar.add( makeColorRadioButton(Color.GREEN,group,false) );\\ntoolbar.add( makeColorRadioButton(Color.BLUE,group,false) );\\ntoolbar.addSeparator(new Dimension(20,20));\\ntoolbar.add( makeClearButton() );\\n}\\nNote that the gray outline of the tool bar comes from two sourc es: The line at the bottom\\nshows the background color of the main panel, which is visibl e because the BorderLayout that\\nis used on that panel has vertical and horizontal gaps of 2 pix els. The other three sides are\\npart of the border of the main panel.\\nIf you want a vertical tool bar that can be placed in the EAST or WEST position of a Border-\\nLayout, you should specify the orientation in the tool bar’s constr uctor:\\nJToolBar toolbar = new JToolBar( JToolBar.VERTICAL );\\nThe default orientation is JToolBar.HORIZONTAL. The orientation is adjusted automatically\\nwhen the user drags the toolbar into a new position. If you wan t to prevent the user from\\ndragging the toolbar, just say toolbar.setFloatable(false).\\n12.3.5 Keyboard Accelerators\\nIn most programs, commonly used menu commands have keyboard equivalents. The user\\ncan type the keyboard equivalent instead of selecting the co mmand from the menu, and the\\nresult will be exactly the same. Typically , for example, the “Save” command has keyboard'),\n",

ADV ANCED GUI PROGRAMMING\\nequivalent CONTROL-C, and the “Undo” command corresponds to CONTROL-Z. (Under Mac OS,\\nthe keyboard equivalents for these commands would probably be META-C and META-Z, where\\nMETA refers to holding down the “apple” key .) The keyboard equiva lents for menu commands\\nare referred to as accelerators.\\nThe class javax.swing.KeyStroke is used to represent key strokes that the user can type\\non the keyboard. A key stroke consists of pressing a key , poss ibly while holding down one or\\nmore of the modiﬁer keys control, shift, alt, and meta. The KeyStroke class has a static\\nmethod, getKeyStroke(String), that makes it easy to create key stroke objects. F or example ,\\nKeyStroke.getKeyStroke( \"ctrl S\" )\\nreturns a KeyStroke that represents the action of pressing the “S” key while hold ing down the\\ncontrol key . In addition to “ctrl”, you can use the modiﬁers “ shift”, “alt”, and “meta” in the\\nstring that describes the key stroke. Y ou can even combine se veral modiﬁers, so that\\nKeyStroke.getKeyStroke( \"ctrl shift Z\" )\\nrepresents the action of pressing the “Z” key while holding d own both the control and the shift\\nkeys. When the key stroke involves pressing a character key , the character must appear in the\\nstring in upper case form. Y ou can also have key strokes that c orrespond to non-character keys.\\nThe number keys can be referred to as “1”, “2”, etc., while cer tain special keys have names\\nsuch as “F1”, “ENTER”, and “LEFT” (for the left arrow key). Th e class KeyEvent deﬁnes\\nmany constants such as VK ENTER, VK LEFT, and VK S. The names that are used for keys in the\\nkeystroke description are just these constants with the lea ding “ VK ” removed.\\nThere are at least two ways to associate a keyboard accelerat or with a menu item. One is\\nto use the setAccelerator() method of the menu item object:\\nJMenuItem saveCommand = new JMenuItem( \"Save...\" );\\nsaveCommand.setAccelerator( KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(\"ctrl S\") );\\nThe other technique can be used if the menu item is created fro m an Action. The action property\\nAction.ACCELERATOR\\nKEY can be used to associate a KeyStroke with an Action. When a menu\\nitem is created from the action, the keyboard accelerator fo r the menu item is taken from the\\nvalue of this property . F or example, if redoAction is an Action representing a “Redo” action,\\nthen you might say:\\nredoAction.putValue( Action.ACCELERATOR KEY,\\nKeyStroke.getKeyStroke(\"ctrl shift Z\") );\\nJMenuItem redoCommand = new JMenuItem( redoAction );\\nor, alternatively , you could simply add the action to a JMenu, editMenu, with\\neditMenu.add(redoAction). (Note, by the way , that accelerators apply only to menu item s,\\nnot to push buttons. When you create a JButton from an action, the ACCELERATOR KEY property\\nof the action is ignored.)\\nNote that you can use accelerators for JCheckBoxMenuItems and JRadioButtonMenuItems,\\nas well as for simple JMenuItems.\\nF or an example of using keyboard accelerators, see the solut ion to Exercise 12.2.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nBy the way , as noted above, in the Macintosh operating system , the meta (or apple) key\\nis usually used for keyboard accelerators instead of the con trol key . If you would like to make\\nyour program more Mac-friendly , you can test whether your pr ogram is running under Mac OS\\nand, if so, adapt your accelerators to the Mac OS style.

This function call happens\\nto return a non-null value under Mac OS but returns null under other operating systems.

HTML is the markup\\nlanguage that is used to write web pages. A brief introductio n to HTML can be found in\\nSubsection 6.2.3. HTML allows you to apply color or italics o r other styles to just part of the\\ntext on your buttons. It also makes it possible to have button s that display multiple lines of\\ntext. (Y ou can also use HTML on JLabels, which can be even more useful.) Here’s a picture of\\na button with HTML text (along with a “Java” icon):\\nIf the string of text that is applied to a button starts with “ <html>”, then the string is\\ninterpreted as HTML. The string does not have to use strict HT ML format; for example, you\\ndon’t need a closing </html> at the end of the string. T o get multi-line text, use <br> in the\\nstring to represent line breaks. If you would like the lines o f text to be center justiﬁed, include\\nthe entire text (except for the <html>) between <center> and </center>. F or example,\\nJButton button = new JButton(\\n\"<html><center>This button has<br>two lines of text</center>\" );\\ncreates a button that displays two centered lines of text. Y o u can apply italics to part of the\\nstring by enclosing that part between <i> and </i>. Similarly , use <b>...</b> for bold text and\\n<u>...</u> for underlined text. F or green text, enclose the text betwee n <font color=green>\\nand </font >.

While this is true,\\na lot of that complexity works to your beneﬁt as a programmer, since a lot of it is hidden in\\nnormal uses of Swing components. F or example, you don’t have to know about all the complex\\ndetails of buttons in order to use them eﬀectively in most pro grams.\\nSwing deﬁnes several component classes that are much more co mplex than those we have\\nlooked at so far, but even the most complex components are not very diﬃcult to use for many\\npurposes. In this section, we’ll look at components that sup port display and manipulation of\\nlists, tables, and text documents. T o use these complex comp onents eﬀectively , you’ll need to\\nknow something about the Model-View-Controller pattern th at is used as a basis for the design\\nof many Swing components. This pattern is discussed in the ﬁr st part of this section.\\nThis section is our last look at Swing components, but there a re a number of component\\nclasses that have not even been touched on in this book. Some u seful ones that you might want\\nto look into include: JT abbedPane, JSplitPane, JT ree, JSpinner, JPopupMenu, JProgressBar,\\nJScrollBar, and JPasswordField.\\nAt the end of the section, we’ll look brieﬂy at the idea of writ ing custom component classes—\\nsomething that you might consider when even the large variet y of components that are already\\ndeﬁned in Swing don’t do quite what you want.\\n12.4.1 Model-View-Controller\\nOne of the principles of object-oriented design is division of responsibilities. Ideally , an object\\nshould have a single, clearly deﬁned role, with a limited rea lm of responsibility . One application\\nof this principle to the design of graphical user interfaces is the MVC pattern . “MVC” stands\\nfor “Model-View-Controller” and refers to three diﬀerent r ealms of responsibility in the design\\nof a graphical user interface.\\nWhen the MVC pattern is applied to a component, the model consists of the data that\\nrepresents the current state of the component. The view is simply the visual presentation of\\nthe component on the screen. And the controller is the aspect of the component that carries\\nout actions in response to events generated by the user. The i dea is to assign responsibility for\\nthe model, the view, and the controller to diﬀerent objects.\\nThe view is the easiest part of the MVC pattern to understand. It is often represented by\\nthe component object itself, and its responsibility is to dr aw the component on the screen. In\\ndoing this, of course, it has to consult the model, since the m odel represents the state of the\\ncomponent, and that state can determine what appears on the s creen. T o get at the model\\ndata—which is stored in a separate object according to the MV C pattern—the component\\nobject needs to keep a reference to the model object. F urther more, when the model changes,\\nthe view might have to be redrawn to reﬂect the changed state. The component needs some way\\nof knowing when changes in the model occur. Typically , in Jav a, this is done with events and\\nlisteners. The model object is set up to generate events when its data changes. The view object'),\n",

When the mod el changes, an event is generated,\\nthe view is notiﬁed of that event, and the view responds by upd ating its appearance on the\\nscreen.\\nWhen MVC is used for Swing components, the controller is gene rally not so well deﬁned as\\nthe model and view, and its responsibilities are often split among several objects. The controller\\nmight include mouse and keyboard listeners that respond to u ser events on the view; Actions\\nthat respond to menu commands or buttons; and listeners for o ther high-level events, such as\\nthose from a slider, that aﬀect the state of the component. Us ually , the controller responds\\nto events by making modiﬁcations to the model, and the view is changed only indirectly , in\\nresponse to the changes in the model.\\nThe MVC pattern is used in many places in the design of Swing. I t is even used for buttons.\\nThe state of a Swing button is stored in an object of type ButtonModel. The model stores such\\ninformation as whether the button is enabled, whether it is s elected, and what ButtonGroup it\\nis part of, if any . If button is of type JButton (or one of the other subclasses of AbstractButton),\\nthen its ButtonModel can be obtained by calling button.getModel(). In the case of buttons,\\nyou might never need to use the model or even know that it exist s. But for the list and table\\ncomponents that we will look at next, knowledge of the model i s essential.\\n12.4.2 Lists and ListModels\\nA JList is a component that represents a list of items that can be sele cted by the user. The\\nsample program SillyStamper.java allows the user to select one icon from a JList of Icons. The\\nuser selects an icon from the list by clicking on it. The selec ted icon can be “stamped” onto a\\ndrawing area by clicking on the drawing area. (The icons in th is program are from the KDE\\ndesktop project.) Here is a picture of the program with sever al icons already stamped onto the\\ndrawing area and with the “light bulb” icon selected:\\nNote that the scrollbar in this program is not part of the JList. T o add a scrollbar to a list,\\nthe list must be placed into a JScrollPane. See Subsection 6.6.4, where the use of JScrollPane\\nto hold a JT extArea was discussed. Scroll panes are used in the same way with list s and with\\nother components. In this case, the JList, iconList, was added to a scroll pane and the scroll\\npane was added to a panel with the single command:\\nadd( new JScrollPane(iconList), BorderLayout.EAST );'),\n",

ADV ANCED GUI PROGRAMMING\\nOne way to construct a JList is from an array that contains the objects that will appear\\nin the list. The items can be of any type, but only icons and str ings can actually appear in\\nthe list; an item that is not of type Icon or String is converted into a string by calling its\\ntoString() method. (It’s possible to “teach” a JList to display other types of items; see the\\nsetCellRenderer() method in the JList class.) In the SillyStamper program, the images for\\nthe icons are read from resource ﬁles, the icons are placed in to an array , and the array is used\\nto construct the list. This is done by the following method:\\nprivate JList createIconList() {\\nString[] iconNames = new String[] {\\n\"icon5.png\", \"icon7.png\", \"icon8.png\", \"icon9.png\", \"icon10.png\",\\n\"icon11.png\", \"icon24.png\", \"icon25.png\", \"icon26.png\", \"icon31.png\",\\n\"icon33.png\", \"icon34.png\"\\n}; // Array containing resource file names for the icon image s.\\niconImages = new Image[iconNames.length];\\nClassLoader classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();\\nToolkit toolkit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();\\ntry { // Get the icon images from the resource files.\\nfor (int i = 0; i < iconNames.length; i++) {\\nURL imageURL = classLoader.getResource(\"stamper\\nicons/\" + iconNames[i]);\\nif (imageURL == null)\\nthrow new Exception();\\niconImages[i] = toolkit.createImage(imageURL);\\n}\\n}\\ncatch (Exception e) {\\niconImages = null;\\nreturn null;\\n}\\nImageIcon[] icons = new ImageIcon[iconImages.length];\\nfor (int i = 0; i < iconImages.length; i++) // Create the icons .\\nicons[i] = new ImageIcon(iconImages[i]);\\nJList list = new JList(icons); // A list containing the image icons.\\nlist.setSelectionMode(ListSelectionModel.SINGLE\\nSELECTION);\\nlist.setSelectedIndex(0); // First item in the list is curr ently selected.\\nreturn list;\\n}\\nBy default, the user can select any number of items in a list. A single item is selected by\\nclicking on it. Multiple items can be selected by shift-clic king and by either control-clicking or\\nmeta-clicking (depending on the platform). In the SillyStamper program, I wanted to restrict\\nthe selection so that only one item can be selected at a time. T his restriction is imposed by\\ncalling\\nlist.setSelectionMode(ListSelectionModel.SINGLE SELECTION);\\nWith this selection mode, when the user selects an item, the p reviously selected item, if\\nany , is deselected. Note that the selection can be changed by the program by calling\\nlist.setSelectedIndex(itemNum). Items are numbered starting from zero. T o ﬁnd out the\\ncurrently selected item in single selection mode, call list.getSelectedIdex(). This returns'),\n",

If multiple selec-\\ntions are allowed, you can call list.getSelectedIndices(), which returns an array of ints\\nthat contains the item numbers of all selected items.\\nNow, the list that you see on the screen is only the view aspect of the list. The controller\\nconsists of the listener objects that respond when the user c licks an item in the list. F or its\\nmodel, a JList uses an object of type ListModel. This is the object that knows the actual list of\\nitems. Now, a model is deﬁned not only by the data that it conta ins but by the set of operations\\nthat can be performed on the data. When a JList is constructed from an array of objects, the\\nmodel that is used is very simple. The model can tell you how ma ny items it contains and what\\nthose items are, but it can’t do much else. In particular, the re is no way to add items to the\\nlist or to delete items from the list. If you need that capabil ity , you will have to use a diﬀerent\\nlist model.\\nThe class DefaultListModel deﬁnes list models that support adding items to and removing\\nitems from the list. (Note that the list model that you get whe n you create a JList from an\\narray is not of this type.) If dlmodel is of type DefaultListModel, the following methods, among\\nothers, are deﬁned:\\n• dlmodel.getSize() — returns the number of items\\n• dlmodel.getElementAt(index) — returns the item at position index in the list.\\n• dlmodel.addElement(item) — Adds item to the end of the list; item can be any Object.\\n• dlmodel.insertElementAt(item, index) — inserts the speciﬁed item into the list at\\nthe speciﬁed index; items that come after that position in the list are moved dow n to\\nmake room for the new item.\\n• dlmodel.setElementAt(item, index) — Replaces the item that is currently at position\\nindex in the list with item.\\n• dlmodel.remove(index) — removes the item at position index in the list.\\n• dlmodel.removeAllElements() — removes everything from the list, leaving it empty .\\nT o use a modiﬁable JList, you should create a DefaultListModel, add any items to it that\\nshould be in the list initially , and pass it to the JList constructor. F or example:\\nDefaultListModel listModel; // Should probably be instanc e variables!\\nJList flavorList;\\nlistModel = new DefaultListModel(); // Create the model obj ect.\\nlistModel.addElement(\"Chocolate\"); // Add items to the mo del.\\nlistModel.addElement(\"Vanilla\");\\nlistModel.addElement(\"Strawberry\");\\nlistModel.addElement(\"Rum Raisen\");\\nflavorList = new JList(listModel); // Create the list compo nent.\\nBy keeping a reference to the model around in an instance vari able, you will be able to add and\\ndelete ﬂavors as the program is running by calling the approp riate methods in listModel. Keep\\nin mind that changes that are made to the model will automatically be reﬂected in the view.\\nBehind the scenes, when a list model is modiﬁed, it generates an event of type ListDataEvent.\\nThe JList registers itself with its model as a listener for these event s, and it responds to an\\nevent by redrawing itself to reﬂect the changes in the model. The programmer doesn’t have to\\ntake any extra action, beyond changing the model.'),\n",

ADV ANCED GUI PROGRAMMING\\nBy the way , the model for a JList actually has another part in addition to the ListModel : An\\nobject of type ListSelectionModel stores information about which items in the list are current ly\\nselected. When the model is complex, it’s not uncommon to use several model objects to store\\ndiﬀerent aspects of the state.\\n12.4.3 T ables and T ableModels\\nLike a JList, a JT able displays a collection of items to the user. However, tables a re much more\\ncomplicated than lists. Perhaps the most important diﬀeren ce is that it is possible for the user\\nto edit items in the table. T able items are arranged in a grid o f rows and columns. Each grid\\nposition is called a cell of the table. Each column can have a header, which appears at the\\ntop of the column and contains a name for the column.\\nIt is easy to create a JT able from an array that contains the names of the columns and a\\ntwo-dimensional array that contains the items that go into t he cells of the table. As an example,\\nthe sample program StatesAndCapitalsTableDemo.java creates a table with two columns named\\n“State” and “Capital City .” The ﬁrst column contains a list o f the states of the United States\\nand the second column contains the name of the capital city of each state. The table can be\\ncreated as follows:\\nString[][] statesAndCapitals = new String[][] {\\n{ \"Alabama\", \"Montgomery\" },\\n{ \"Alaska\", \"Juneau\" },\\n{ \"Arizona\", \"Phoenix\" },\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n{ \"Wisconsin\", \"Madison\" },\\n{ \"Wyoming\", \"Cheyenne\" }\\n};\\nString[] columnHeads = new String[] { \"State\", \"Capital City\" };\\nJTable table = new JTable(statesAndCapitals, columnHeads);\\nSince a table does not come with its own scroll bars, it is almo st always placed in a JScrollPane\\nto make it possible to scroll the table. In the example progra m this is done with:\\nadd( new JScrollPane(table), BorderLayout.CENTER );\\nThe column headers of a JT able are not actually part of the table; they are in a separate\\ncomponent. But when you add the table to a JScrolPane, the column headers are automatically\\nplaced at the top of the pane.\\nUsing the default settings, the user can edit any cell in the t able. (T o select an item\\nfor editing, click it and start typing. The arrow keys can be u sed to move from one cell to\\nanother.) The user can change the order of the columns by drag ging a column header to a new\\nposition. The user can also change the width of the columns by dragging the line that separates\\nneighboring column headers. Y ou can try all this in the sampl e program; there is an applet\\nversion in the on-line version of this section.\\nAllowing the user to edit all entries in the table is not alway s appropriate; certainly it’s not\\nappropriate in the “states and capitals” example. A JT able uses an object of type T ableModel\\nto store information about the contents of the table. The mod el object is also responsible for\\ndeciding whether or not the user should be able to edit any giv en cell in the table. T ableModel\\nincludes the method'),\n",

When the controller wants to know whether a certain cell is editable, it\\ncalls this method in the table model. If the return value is tr ue, the user is allowed to edit the\\ncell.\\nThe default model that is used when the table is created, as ab ove, from an array of objects\\nallows editing of all cells. F or this model, the return value of isCellEditable() is true in all\\ncases. T o make some cells non-editable, you have to provide a diﬀerent model for the table. One\\nway to do this is to create a subclass of DefaultT ableModel and override the isCellEditable()\\nmethod. ( DefaultT ableModel and some other classes that are discussed in this section are\\ndeﬁned in the package javax.swing.table.) Here is how this might be done in the “states and\\ncapitals” program to make all cells non-editable:\\nTableModel model = new DefaultTableModel(statesAndCapitals,columnHeads) {\\npublic boolean isCellEditable(int row, int col) {\\nreturn false;\\n}\\n};\\nJTable table = new JTable(model);\\nHere, an anonymous subclass of DefaultT ableModel is created in which the isCellEditable()\\nmethod returns false in all cases, and the model object that is created from that cl ass is passed\\nas a parameter to the JT able constructor.\\nThe DefaultT ableModel class deﬁnes many methods that can be used to modify the table ,\\nincluding for example: setValueAt(item,rowNum,colNum) to change the item in a given cell;\\nremoveRow(rowNum) to delete a row; and addRow(itemArray) to add a new row at the end of\\nthe table that contains items from the array itemArray. Note that if the item in a given cell\\nis null, then that cell will be empty . Remember, again, that when you modify the model, the\\nview is automatically changed to reﬂect the changes.\\nIn addition to the isCellEditable() method, the table model method that you are most\\nlikely to want to override is getColumnClass(), which is deﬁned as\\npublic Class<?> getColumnClass(columnNum)\\nThe purpose of this method is to specify what kind of values ar e allowed in the speciﬁed\\ncolumn. The return value from this method is of type Class. (The “ <?>” is there for technical\\nreasons having to do with generic programming. See Section 1 0.5, but don’t worry about\\nunderstanding it here.) Although class objects have crept i nto this book in a few places—\\nin the discussion of ClassLoaders in Subsection 12.1.3 for example—this is the ﬁrst time we\\nhave directly encountered the class named Class. An object of type Class represents a class.\\nA Class object is usually obtained from the name of the class using ex pressions of the form\\n“ Double.class” or “ JTable.class”. If you want a three-column table in which the column\\ntypes are String, Double, and Boolean, you can use a table model in which getColumnClass is\\ndeﬁned as:\\npublic Class<?> getColumnClass(columnNum) {\\nif (columnNum == 0)\\nreturn String.class;\\nelse if (columnNum = 1)\\nreturn Double.class;\\nelse\\nreturn Boolean.class;'),\n",

F or example, if a column is speciﬁed to hol d Boolean values, the cells in that\\ncolumn will be displayed and edited as check boxes. F or numer ic types, the table will not accept\\nillegal input when the user types in the value. (It is possibl e to change the way that a table\\nedits or displays items. See the methods setDefaultEditor() and setDefaultRenderer() in\\nthe JT able class.)\\nAs an alternative to using a subclass of DefaultT ableModel, a custom table model can also\\nbe deﬁned using a subclass of AbstractT ableModel. Whereas DefaultT ableModel provides a lot\\nof predeﬁned functionality , AbstractT ableModel provides very little. However, using Abstract-\\nT ableModel gives you the freedom to represent the table data any way you w ant. The sample\\nprogram ScatterPlotTableDemo.java uses a subclass of AbstractT ableModel to deﬁne the model\\nfor a JT able. In this program, the table has three columns. The ﬁrst colum n holds a row\\nnumber and is not editable. The other columns hold values of t ype Double; these two columns\\nrepresent the x- and y-coordinates of points in the plane. Th e points themselves are graphed in\\na “scatter plot” next to the table. Initially , the program ﬁl ls in the ﬁrst six points with random\\nvalues. Here is a picture of the program, with the x-coordina te in row 5 selected for editing:\\nNote, by the way , that in this program, the scatter plot can be considered to be a view of\\nthe table model, in the same way that the table itself is. The s catter plot registers itself as a\\nlistener with the model, so that it will receive notiﬁcation whenever the model changes. When\\nthat happens, the scatter plot redraws itself to reﬂect the n ew state of the model. It is an\\nimportant property of the MVC pattern that several views can share the same model, oﬀering\\nalternative presentations of the same data. The views don’t have to know about each other\\nor communicate with each other except by sharing the model. A lthough I didn’t do it in this\\nprogram, it would even be possible to add a controller to the s catter plot view. This would let\\nthe user drag a point in the scatter plot to change its coordin ates. Since the scatter plot and\\ntable share the same model, the values in the table would auto matically change to match.\\nHere is the deﬁnition of the class that deﬁnes the model in the scatter plot program.

This\\nis done in the sample program SimpleWebBrowser.java. In this program, the user enters the\\nURL of a web page, and the program tries to load and display the web page at that location.\\nA JEditorPane can handle pages with content type “text/plain”, “text/htm l”, and “text/rtf”.\\n(The content type “text/rtf” represents styled or “rich tex t format” text. URLs and content\\ntypes were covered in Subsection 11.4.1.) If editPane is of type JEditorPane and url is of type\\nURL, then the statement “ editPane.setPage(url);” is suﬃcient to load the page and display\\nit. Since this can generate an exception, the following meth od is used in SimpleWebBrowser.java\\nto display a page:\\nprivate void loadURL(URL url) {\\ntry {\\neditPane.setPage(url);\\n}\\ncatch (Exception e) {\\neditPane.setContentType(\"text/plain\"); // Set pane to display plain text.\\neditPane.setText( \"Sorry, the requested document was not found\\\\n\"\\n+\"or cannot be displayed.\\\\n\\\\nError:\" + e);\\n}\\n}'),\n",

COMPLEX COMPONENTS AND MVC 655\\nAn HTML document can display links to other pages. When the us er clicks on a link, the\\nweb browser should go to the linked page. A JEditorPane does not do this automatically , but\\nit does generate an event of type HyperLinkEvent when the user clicks a link (provided that the\\nedit pane has been set to be non-editable by the user). A progr am can register a listener for\\nsuch events and respond by loading the new page.\\nThere are a lot of web pages that a JEditorPane won’t be able to display correctly , but it\\ncan be very useful in cases where you have control over the pag es that will be displayed. A\\nnice application is to distribute HTML-format help and info rmation ﬁles with a program. The\\nﬁles can be stored as resource ﬁles in the jar ﬁle of the progra m, and a URL for a resource\\nﬁle can be obtained in the usual way , using the getResource() method of a ClassLoader. (See\\nSubsection 12.1.3.)\\nIt turns out, by the way , that SimpleWebBrowser.java is a little too simple. A modiﬁed\\nversion, SimpleWebBrowserWithThread.java, improves on the original by using a thread to load\\na page and by checking the content type of a page before trying to load it. It actually does\\nwork as a simple web browser.\\nThe model for a JT extComponent is an object of type Document. If you want to be notiﬁed\\nof changes in the model, you can add a listener to the model usi ng\\ntextComponent.getDocument().addDocumentListener(listener)\\nwhere textComponent is of type JT extComponent and listener is of type DocumentListener.\\nThe Document class also has methods that make it easy to read a document fro m a ﬁle and\\nwrite a document to a ﬁle. I won’t discuss all the things you ca n do with text components here.\\nF or one more peek at their capabilities, see the sample progr am SimpleRTFEdit.java, a very\\nminimal editor for ﬁles that contain styled text of type “tex t/rtf.”\\n12.4.5 Custom Components\\nJava’s standard component classes are often all you need to c onstruct a user interface. At some\\npoint, however, you might need a component that Java doesn’t provide. In that case, you can\\nwrite your own component class, building on one of the compon ents that Java does provide.\\nW e’ve already done this, actually , every time we’ve written a subclass of the JPanel class to use\\nas a drawing surface. A JPanel is a blank slate. By deﬁning a subclass, you can make it show\\nany picture you like, and you can program it to respond in any w ay to mouse and keyboard\\nevents. Sometimes, if you are lucky , you don’t need such free dom, and you can build on one of\\nJava’s more sophisticated component classes.\\nF or example, suppose I have a need for a “stopwatch” componen t. When the user clicks\\non the stopwatch, I want it to start timing. When the user clic ks again, I want it to display\\nthe elapsed time since the ﬁrst click. The textual display ca n be done with a JLabel, but\\nwe want a JLabel that can respond to mouse clicks. W e can get this behavior by d eﬁning a\\nStopWatchLabel component as a subclass of the JLabel class. A StopWatchLabel object will\\nlisten for mouse clicks on itself. The ﬁrst time the user clic ks, it will change its display to\\n“Timing...” and remember the time when the click occurred. W hen the user clicks again, it\\nwill check the time again, and it will compute and display the elapsed time. (Of course, I don’t\\nnecessarily have to deﬁne a subclass. I could use a regular la bel in my program, set up a listener\\nto respond to mouse events on the label, and let the program do the work of keeping track of\\nthe time and changing the text displayed on the label. Howeve r, by writing a new class, I\\nhave something that can be reused in other projects. I also have all the code involved in the'),\n",

Suppose that—for no\\ngood reason whatsoever—I want a component that acts like a JLabel except that it displays\\nits text in mirror-reversed form. Since no standard compone nt does anything like this, the\\nMirrorT ext class is deﬁned as a subclass of JPanel. It has a constructor that speciﬁes the text to\\nbe displayed and a setText() method that changes the displayed text. The paintComponent()\\nmethod draws the text mirror-reversed, in the center of the c omponent. This uses techniques\\ndiscussed in Subsection 12.1.1 and Subsection 12.2.1. Info rmation from a FontMetrics object\\nis used to center the text in the component. The reversal is ac hieved by using an oﬀ-screen\\ncanvas. The text is drawn to the oﬀ-screen canvas, in the usua l way . Then the image is copied\\nto the screen with the following command, where OSC is the variable that refers to the oﬀ-screen\\ncanvas, and width and height give the size of both the component and the oﬀ-screen canvas:\\ng.drawImage(OSC, width, 0, 0, height, 0, 0, width, height, this);\\nThis is the version of drawImage() that speciﬁes corners of destination and source rect-\\nangles. The corner (0,0) in OSC is matched to the corner (width,0) on the screen, while\\n(width,height) is matched to (0,height). This reverses the image left-to-right.

F or a custom\\ncomponent based on a JPanel, it’s a good idea to provide a custom preferred size. Every\\ncomponent has a method setPrefferedSize() that can be used to set the preferred size of\\nthe component. F or our MirrorT ext component, however, the preferred size depends the font\\nand the text of the component, and these can change from time t o time. W e need a way to\\ncompute a preferred size on demand, based on the current font and text. That’s what we do by\\ndeﬁning a getPreferredSize() method. The system calls this method when it wants to know\\nthe preferred size of the component. In response, we can comp ute the preferred size based on\\nthe current font and text.\\nThe StopWatchLabel and MirrorT ext classes deﬁne components. Components don’t stand\\non their own. Y ou have to add them to an panel or other containe r. The sample program Cus-\\ntomComponentTest.java demonstrates using a MirrorT ext and a StopWatchLabel component.\\nIn this program, the two custom components and a button are ad ded to a panel that uses\\na FlowLayout as its layout manager, so the components are not arranged ver y neatly . If you\\nclick the button labeled “Change T ext in this Program”, the t ext in all the components will\\nbe changed. Y ou can also click on the stopwatch label to start and stop the stopwatch. When\\nyou do any of these things, you will notice that the component s will be rearranged to take the\\nnew sizes into account. This is known as “validating” the con tainer. This is done automatically\\nwhen a standard component changes in some way that requires a change in preferred size or\\nlocation. This may or may not be the behavior that you want. (V alidation doesn’t always\\ncause as much disruption as it does in this program. F or examp le, in a GridLayout, where all\\nthe components are displayed at the same size, it will have no eﬀect at all. I chose a FlowLayout\\nfor this example to make the eﬀect more obvious.)

Most of the examples in this book have been “toy”\\nprograms that illustrated one or two points about programmi ng techniques. It’s time to put it\\nall together into a full-scale program that uses many of the t echniques that we have covered,\\nand a few more besides. After discussing the program and its b asic design, I’ll use it as an\\nexcuse to talk brieﬂy about some of the features of Java that d idn’t ﬁt into the rest of this\\nbook.\\nThe program that we will look at is a Mandelbrot Viewer that le ts the user explore the\\nfamous Mandelbrot set. I will begin by explaining what that m eans. If you have downloaded\\nthe web version of this book, note that the jar ﬁle MandelbrotViewer.jar is an executable jar\\nﬁle that you can use to run the program as a stand-alone applic ation. The jar ﬁle is in the\\ndirectory c12, which contains all the ﬁles for this chapter. The on-line ve rsion of this page has\\ntwo applet versions of the program. One shows the program run ning on the web page. The\\nother applet appears on the web page as a button; clicking the button opens the program in a\\nseparate window.\\n12.5.1 The Mandelbrot Set\\nThe Mandelbrot set is a set of points in the xy-plane that is de ﬁned by a computational\\nprocedure. T o use the program, all you really need to know is t hat the Mandelbrot set can be\\nused to make some pretty pictures, but here are the mathemati cal details: Consider the point\\nthat has real-number coordinates (a,b) and apply the following computation:\\nLet x = a\\nLet y = b\\nRepeat:\\nLet newX = x*x - y*y + a\\nLet newY = 2*x*y + b\\nLet x = newX\\nLet y = newY\\nAs the loop is repeated, the point (x,y) changes. The question is, does (x,y) grow without\\nbound or is it trapped forever in a ﬁnite region of the plane? I f (x,y) escapes to inﬁnity (that\\nis, grows without bound), then the starting point (a,b) is not in the Mandelbrot set. If (x,y)\\nis trapped in a ﬁnite region, then (a,b) is in the Mandelbrot set. Now, it is known that if\\nx2 + y2 ever becomes strictly greater than 4, then (x,y) will escape to inﬁnity . If x2 + y2\\never becomes bigger than 4 in the above loop, we can end the loo p and say that (a,b) is not\\nin the Mandelbrot set. F or a point (a,b) in the Mandelbrot set, this will never happen. When\\nwe do this on a computer, of course, we don’t want to have a loop that runs forever, so we put\\na limit on the number of times that the loop is executed:\\nx = a;\\ny = b;'),\n",

If count is greater than maxIterations, then (a,b) might or might\\nnot be in the Mandelbrot set (but the larger maxIterations is, the more likely that (a,b) is\\nactually in the set).\\nT o make a picture from this procedure, use a rectangular grid of pixels to represent some\\nrectangle in the plane. Each pixel corresponds to some real n umber coordinates (a,b). (Use\\nthe coordinates of the center of the pixel.) Run the above loo p for each pixel. If the count goes\\npast maxIterations, color the pixel black; this is a point that is possibly in the Mandelbrot set.\\nOtherwise, base the color of the pixel on the value of count after the loop ends, using diﬀerent\\ncolors for diﬀerent counts. In some sense, the higher the cou nt, the closer the point is to the\\nMandelbrot set, so the colors give some information about po ints outside the set and about\\nthe shape of the set. However, it’s important to understand t hat the colors are arbitrary and\\nthat colored points are not in the set. Here is a picture that was produced by the Mandelbr ot\\nViewer program using this computation. The black region is t he Mandelbrot set:\\nWhen you use the program, you can “zoom in” on small regions of the plane. T o do so, just\\ndrag the mouse on the picture. This will draw a rectangle arou nd part of the picture. When\\nyou release the mouse, the part of the picture inside the rect angle will be zoomed to ﬁll the\\nentire display . If you simply click a point in the picture, yo u will zoom in on the point where\\nyou click by a magniﬁcation factor of two. (Shift-click or us e the right mouse button to zoom\\nout instead of zooming in.) The interesting points are along the boundary of the Mandelbrot'),\n",

(Note that i f you zoom in too far, you will\\nexceed the capabilities of the double data type; nothing is done in the program to prevent this.)\\nUse the “MaxIterations” menu to increase the maximum number of iterations in the loop.\\nRemember that black pixels might or might not be in the set; wh en you increase “MaxIter-\\nations,” you might ﬁnd that a black region becomes ﬁlled with color. The “Palette” menu\\ndetermines the set of colors that are used. Diﬀerent palette s give very diﬀerent visualizations\\nof the set. The “PaletteLength” menu determines how many diﬀ erent colors are used. In the\\ndefault setting, a diﬀerent color is used for each possible v alue of count in the algorithm. Some-\\ntimes, you can get a much better picture by using a diﬀerent nu mber of colors. If the palette\\nlength is less than maxIterations, the palette is repeated to cover all the possible values of\\ncount; if the palette length is greater than maxIterations, only part of of the palette will be\\nused. (If the picture is of an almost uniform color, try decreasing the palette length, since that\\nmakes the color vary more quickly as count changes. If you see what look like randomly colored\\ndots instead of bands of color, try increasing the palette length.)\\nIf you run the Mandelbrot Viewer program as a stand-alone app lication, it will have a “File”\\nmenu that can be used to save the picture as a PNG image ﬁle. Y ou can also save a “param”\\nﬁle which simply saves the settings that produced the curren t picture. A param ﬁle can be read\\nback into the program using the “Open” command.\\nThe Mandelbrot set is named after Benoit Mandelbrot, who was the ﬁrst person to note the\\nincredible complexity of the set. It is astonishing that suc h complexity and beauty can arise\\nout of such a simple algorithm.\\n12.5.2 Design of the Program\\nMost classes in Java are deﬁned in packages. While we have use d standard packages such\\nas javax.swing and java.io extensively , all of my programming examples have been in the\\n“default package,” which means that they are not declared to belong to any named package.\\nHowever, when doing more serious programming, it is good sty le to create a package to hold\\nthe classes for your program. Sun Microsystems recommends t hat package names should be\\nbased on an Internet domain name of the organization that pro duces the package. My oﬃce\\ncomputer has domain name eck.hws.edu, and no other computer in the world should have\\nthe same name. According to Sun, this allows me to use the pack age name edu.hws.eck,\\nwith the elements of the domain name in reverse order. I can al so use sub-packages of this\\npackage, such as edu.hws.eck.mdb, which is the package name that I decided to use for my\\nMandelbrot Viewer application. No one else—or at least no on e else who uses Sun’s naming\\nconvention—will ever use the same package name, so this pack age name uniquely identiﬁes my\\nprogram.\\nI brieﬂy discussed using packages in Subsection 2.6.4. Here ’s what you need to know for the\\nMandelbrot Viewer program: The program is deﬁned in ten Java source code ﬁles. They can be\\nfound in the directory edu/hws/eck/mdb inside the source directory of the web site. (That is,\\nthey are in a directory named mdb, which is inside a directory named eck, which is inside hws,\\nwhich is inside edu. The directory structure must follow the package name in thi s way .) The\\nsame directory also contains a ﬁle named strings.properties that is used by the program and\\nthat will be discussed below. F or an Integrated Development Environment such as Eclipse, you\\nshould just have to add the edu directory to your project. T o compile the ﬁles on the command\\nline, you must be working in the directory that contains the edu directory . Use the command\\njavac edu/hws/eck/mdb/*.java'),\n",

T o run this class, use the command:\\njava edu.hws.eck.mdb.Main\\nThis command must also be given in the directory that contain s the edu directory .\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe work of computing and displaying images of the Mandelbro t set is done in Mandelbrot-\\nDisplay.java. The MandelbrotDisplay class is a subclass of JPanel. It uses an oﬀ-screen canvas\\nto hold a copy of the image. (See Subsection 12.1.1.) The paintComponent() method copies\\nthis image onto the panel. Then, if the user is drawing a “zoom box” with the mouse, the zoom\\nbox is drawn on top of the image. In addition to the image, the c lass uses a two-dimensional\\narray to store the iteration count for each pixel in the image. If the range of xy-values changes ,\\nor if the size of the window changes, all the counts must be recomputed. Since the compu-\\ntation can take quite a while, it would not be acceptable to bl ock the user interface while the\\ncomputation is being performed. The solution is to do the com putation in a separate thread.\\n(See Section 8.5.) When the computation begins, the image is ﬁlled with gray . Every so often,\\nabout twice a second, the data that has been computed by the co mputation thread is gath-\\nered and applied to the oﬀ-screen canvas, and the part of the c anvas that has been modiﬁed\\nis copied to the screen. The user can continue to use the menus and even the mouse while\\nthe image is being computed. Actually , this simpliﬁes thing s a bit, because there can be more\\nthan one computational thread. The program creates as many c omputational threads as there\\nare available processors in the computer, and the task of com puting the image is split among\\nthese threads. The algorithm that is used is essentially the same as the distributed algorithm\\nfrom Subsection 11.5.3, except that in this case all the comp utational threads are on the same\\ncomputer.\\nThe ﬁle MandelbrotPanel.java deﬁnes the main panel of the Mandelbrot Viewer window.\\nMandelbrotPanel is another subclass of JPanel. A MandelbrotPanel is mostly ﬁlled with a Man-\\ndelbrotDisplay. It also adds a JLabel beneath the display . The JLabel is used as a “status bar”\\nthat shows some information that might be interesting to the user. The MandelbrotPanel also\\ndeﬁnes the program’s mouse listener. In addition to handlin g zooming, the mouse listener puts\\nthe x and y coordinates of the current mouse location in the st atus bar as the user moves or\\ndrags the mouse. Also, when the mouse exits the drawing area, the text in the status bar is\\nset to read “Idle”. This is the ﬁrst time that we have seen an ac tual use for mouseMoved and\\nmouseExited events. (See Subsection 6.4.2 and Subsection 6.4.4.)\\nThe menu bar for the program is deﬁned in Menus.java. Commands in the “File” and\\n“Control” menu are deﬁned as Actions. (See Subsection 12.3.1.) Note that among the actions are\\nﬁle manipulation commands that use techniques from Subsect ion 11.2.3, Subsection 11.6.3, and\\nSubsection 12.1.5. The “MaxIterations,” “Palette,” and “P aletteLength” menus each contain a\\ngroup of JRadioButtonMenuItems. (See Subsection 12.3.3.) I have tried several approaches f or\\nhandling such groups, and none of them have satisﬁed me compl etely . In this program, I have\\ndeﬁned a nested class inside Menus to represent each group. F or example, the PaletteManager\\nclass contains the menu items in the “Palette” menu as instan ce variables. It registers an action\\nlistener with each item, and it deﬁnes a few utility routines for operating on the menu. The\\nclasses for the three menus are very similar and should proba bly have been deﬁned as subclasses\\nof some more general class.'),\n",

ADV ANCED GUI PROGRAMMING\\nOne interesting point is that the contents of the menu bar are diﬀerent, depending on\\nwhether the program is being run as an applet or as a stand-alo ne application. Since applets\\ncannot access the ﬁle system, there is no “File” menu for an ap plet. F urthermore, accelerator\\nkeys are generally not functional in an applet that is runnin g on a web page, so accelerator\\nkeys are only added to menu items if the program is being run in its own window. (See\\nSubsection 12.3.5 for information on accelerators.) T o acc omplish this, the constructor in the\\nMenus class has parameters that tell it whether the menu bar will be used in an applet and\\nwhether it will be used in a frame, and these parameters are co nsulted as the menu bar is being\\nbuilt.\\nA third parameter to the constructor is the MandelbrotPanel that is being used in the\\nprogram. Many of the menu commands operate on this panel or on the MandelbrotDisplay that\\nit contains. In order to carry out these commands, the Menus object needs a reference to the\\nMandelbrotPanel. As for the MandelbrotDisplay, the panel has a method getDisplay() that\\nreturns a reference to the display that it contains. So as lon g as the menu bar has a reference\\nto the panel, it can obtain a reference to the display . In prev ious examples, everything was\\nwritten as one large class ﬁle, so all the objects were direct ly available to all the code. When a\\nprogram is made up of multiple interacting ﬁles, getting acc ess to the necessary objects can be\\nmore of a problem.\\nMandelbrotPanel, MandelbrotDisplay, and Menus are the main classes that make up the\\nMandelbrot Viewer program. MandelbrotFrame.java deﬁnes a simple subclass of JFrame that\\nruns the program in its own window. MandelbrotApplet.java deﬁnes an applet that runs the\\nprogram on a web page. (This applet version has an extra “Exam ples” menu that is discussed\\nin the source code ﬁle.) There are a few other classes that I wi ll discuss below.\\nThis brief discussion of the design of the Mandelbrot Viewer has shown that it uses a wide\\nvariety of techniques that were covered earlier in this book . In the rest of this section, we’ll\\nlook at a few new features of Java that were used in the program .\\n12.5.3 Internationalization\\nInternationalization refers to writing a program that is easy to adapt for running i n diﬀerent\\nparts of the world. Internationalization is often referred to as I18n , where 18 is the number of\\nletters between the “I” and the ﬁnal “n” in “Internationaliz ation.” The process of adapting the\\nprogram to a particular location is called localization, and the locations are called locales.\\nLocales diﬀer in many ways, including the type of currency us ed and the format used for\\nnumbers and dates, but the most obvious diﬀerence is languag e. Here, I will discuss how to\\nwrite a program so that it can be easily translated into other languages.\\nThe key idea is that strings that will be presented to the user should not be coded into\\nthe program source code. If they were, then a translator woul d have to search through the\\nentire source code, replacing every string with its transla tion. Then the program would have\\nto be recompiled. In a properly internationalized program, all the strings are stored together\\nin one or more ﬁles that are separate from the source code, whe re they can easily be found and\\ntranslated. And since the source code doesn’t have to be modi ﬁed to do the translation, no\\nrecompilation is necessary .\\nT o implement this idea, the strings are stored in one or more properties ﬁles . A properties\\nﬁle is just a list of key/value pairs. F or translation purpos es, the values are strings that will be\\npresented to the user; these are the strings that have to be tr anslated. The keys are also strings,\\nbut they don’t have to be translated because they will never b e presented to the user. Since\\nthey won’t have to be modiﬁed, the key strings can be used in th e program source code. Each'),\n",

FINISHING TOUCHES 665\\nkey uniquely identiﬁes one of the value strings. The program can use the key string to look up\\nthe corresponding value string from the properties ﬁle. The program only needs to know the\\nkey string; the user will only see the value string. When the p roperties ﬁle is translated, the\\nuser of the program will see diﬀerent value strings.\\nThe format of a properties ﬁle is very simple. The key/value p airs take the form\\nkey.string=value string\\nThere are no spaces in the key string or before the equals sign . The value string can contain\\nspaces or any other characters. If the line ends with a backsl ash (“ \\\\”), the value string can be\\ncontinued on the next line; in this case, spaces at the beginn ing of that line are ignored. One\\nunfortunate detail is that a properties ﬁle can contain only plain ASCII characters. The ASCII\\ncharacter set only supports the English alphabet. Neverthe less, a value string can include\\narbitrary UNICODE characters. Non-ASCII characters just h ave to be specially encoded.\\nSun Microsystems provides a program, native2ascii, that can convert ﬁles that use non-ASCII\\ncharacters into a form that is suitable for use as a propertie s ﬁle.\\nSuppose that the program wants to present a string to the user (as the name of a menu\\ncommand, for example). The properties ﬁle would contain a ke y/value pair such as\\nmenu.saveimage=Save PNG Image...\\nwhere “Save PNG Image. . . ” is the string that will appear in th e menu. The program would\\nuse the key string, “menu.saveimage”, to look up the corresp onding value string and would then\\nuse the value string as the text of the menu item. In Java, the l ook up process is supported\\nby the ResourceBundle class, which knows how to retrieve and use properties ﬁles. S ometimes\\na string that is presented to the user contains substrings th at are not known until the time\\nwhen the program is running. A typical example is the name of a ﬁle. Suppose, for example,\\nthat the program wants to tell the user, “Sorry , the ﬁle, ﬁlename , cannot be loaded”, where\\nﬁlename is the name of a ﬁle that was selected by the user at run time. T o handle cases like\\nthis, value strings in properties ﬁles can include placehol ders that will be replaced by strings\\nto be determined by the program at run time. The placeholders take the form “ {0}”, “ {1}”,\\n“ {2}”, . . . . F or the ﬁle error example, the properties ﬁle might co ntain:\\nerror.cantLoad=Sorry, the file, {0}, cannot be loaded\\nThe program would fetch the value string for the key error.cantLoad. It would then substitute\\nthe actual ﬁle name for the placeholder, “ {0}”. Note that when the string is translated, the\\nword order might be completely diﬀerent. By using a placehol der for the ﬁle name, you can be\\nsure that the ﬁle name will be put in the correct grammatical p osition for the language that is\\nbeing used. Placeholder substitution is not handled by the ResourceBundle class, but Java has\\nanother class, MessageFormat, that makes such substitutions easy .\\nF or the Mandelbrot Viewer program, the properties ﬁle is strings.properties. (Any properties\\nﬁle should have a name that ends in “ .properties”.) Any string that you see when you run\\nthe program comes from this ﬁle. F or handling value string lo okup, I wrote I18n.java. The\\nI18n class has a static method\\npublic static tr( String key, Object... args )\\nthat handles the whole process. Here, key is the key string that will be looked up in\\nstrings.properties. Additional parameters, if any , will be substituted for pla ceholders in\\nthe value string. (Recall that the formal parameter declara tion “ Object...” means that there\\ncan be any number of actual parameters after key; see Subsection 7.2.6.) Typical uses would\\ninclude:'),\n",

The I18n\\nclass is written in a general way so that it can be used in any pr ogram. As long as you provide\\na properties ﬁle as a resource, the only things you need to do a re change the resource ﬁle name\\nin I18n.java and put the class in your own package.\\nIt is actually possible to provide several alternative prop erties ﬁles in the same program. F or\\nexample, you might include F rench and Japanese versions of t he properties ﬁle along with an En-\\nglish version. If the English properties ﬁle is named string.properties, then the names for the\\nF rench and Japanese versions should be strings fr.properties and strings ja.properties.\\nEvery language has a two-letter code, such as “fr” and “ja”, t hat is used in constructing prop-\\nerties ﬁle names for that language. The program asks for the p roperties ﬁle using the simple\\nname “ string”. If the program is being run on a Java system in which the pref erred language\\nis F rench, the program will try to load “ string fr.properties”; if that fails, it will look for\\n“ strings.properties”. This means that the program will use the F rench properties ﬁles in\\na F rench locale; it will use the Japanese properties ﬁle in a J apanese locale; and in any other\\nlocale it will use the default properties ﬁle.\\n12.5.4 Events, Events, Events\\nW e have worked extensively with mouse events, key events, an d action events, but these are\\nonly a few of the event types that are used in Java. The Mandelb rot Viewer program makes use\\nof several other types of events. It also serves as an example of the beneﬁts of event-oriented\\nprogramming.\\nLet’s start from the following fact: The MandelbrotDisplay class knows nothing about any\\nof the other classes that make up the program (with the single exception of one call to the\\ninternationalization method I18n.tr). Y et other classes are aware of things that are going on\\nin the MandelbrotDisplay class. F or example, when the size of the display is changed, t he new size\\nis reported in the status bar that is part of the MandelbrotPanel class. In the Menus class, certain\\nmenus are disabled when the display begins the computation o f an image and are re-enabled\\nwhen the computation completes. The display doesn’t call me thods in the MandelbrotPanel\\nor Menus classes, so how do these classes get their information about what is going on in the\\ndisplay? The answer, of course, is events. The MandelbrotDisplay object emits events of various\\ntypes when various things happen. The MandelbrotPanel and MandelbrotDisplay objects set up\\nlisteners that hear those events and respond to them.\\nThe point is that because events are used for communication, the MandelbrotDisplay class is\\nnot strongly coupled to the other classes. In fact, it can be u sed in other programs without any\\nmodiﬁcation and without access to the other classes. The alt ernative to using events would be to\\nhave the display object call methods such as displaySizeChanged() or computationStarted()\\nin the MandelbrotPanel and MandelbrotFrame objects to tell them what is going on in the display .\\nThis would be strong coupling: Any programmer who wanted to u se MandelbrotDisplay would\\nalso have to use the other two classes or would have to modify t he display class so that it no\\nlonger refers to the other classes. Of course, not everythin g can be done with events and not\\nall strong coupling is bad: The MandelbrotPanel class refers directly to the MandelbrotDisplay\\nclass and cannot be used without it—but since the whole purpo se of a MandelbrotPanel is to\\nhold a MandelbrotDisplay, the coupling is not a problem.\\n∗ ∗ ∗'),\n",

FINISHING TOUCHES 667\\nThe Mandelbrot Viewer program responds to mouse events on th e display . These events\\nare generated by the display object, but the display class it self doesn’t care about mouse events\\nand doesn’t do anything in response to them. Mouse events are handled by a listener in\\nthe MandelbrotPanel, which responds to them by zooming the display and by showing mouse\\ncoordinates in the status bar.\\nThe staus bar also shows the new size of the display whenever t hat size is changed. T o handle\\nthis, events of type ComponentEvent are used. When the size of a component is changed, a\\nComponentEvent is generated. In the Mandelbrot Viewer program, a ComponentListener in\\nthe MandelbrotPanel class listens for size-change events in the display . When on e occurs, the\\nlistener responds by showing the new size in the status bar; t he display knows nothing about\\nthe status bar that shows the display’s size.\\nComponent events are also used internally in the MandelbrotDisplay class in an interesting\\nway . When the user dynamically changes the size of the displa y , its size can change several\\ntimes each second. Normally , a change of display size would t rigger the creation of a new oﬀ-\\nscreen canvas and the start of a new asynchronous computatio n of the image. However, doing\\nthis is a big deal, not something I want to do several times in a second. If you try resizing the\\nprogram’s window, you’ll notice that the image doesn’t chan ge size dynamically as the window\\nsize changes. The same image and oﬀ-screen canvas are used as long as the size is changing.\\nOnly about one-third of a second after the size has stopped ch anging will a new, resized image\\nbe produced. Here is how this works: The display sets up a ComponentEvent to listen for resize\\nevents on itself. When a resize occurs, the listener starts a Timer that has a delay of 1/3 second.\\n(See Subsection 6.5.1.) While this timer is running, the paintComponent() method does not\\nresize the image; instead, it reuses the image that already e xists. If the timer ﬁres 1/3 second\\nlater, the image will be resized at that time. However, if ano ther resize event occurs while the\\nﬁrst timer is running, then the ﬁrst timer will be stopped bef ore it has a chance to ﬁre, and a\\nnew timer will be started with a delay of 1/3 second. The resul t is that the image does not get\\nresized until 1/3 second after the size of the window stops ch anging.\\nThe Mandelbrot Viewer program also uses events of type WindowEvent, which are generated\\nby a window when it opens or closes (among other things). One e xample is in the ﬁle Launcher-\\nApplet.java. This ﬁle deﬁnes an applet that appears as a button on the web p age. The button\\nis labeled “Launch Mandelbrot Viewer”. When the user clicks the button, a MandelbrotFrame\\nis opened on the screen, and the text on the button changes to “ Close Mandelbrot Viewer”.\\nWhen the frame closes, the button changes back to “Launch Man delbrot Viewer”, and the but-\\nton can be used to open another window. The frame can be closed by clicking the button, but\\nit can also be closed using a “Close” command in the frame’s me nu bar or by clicking the close\\nbox in the frame’s title bar. The question is, how does the but ton’s text get changed when the\\nframe is closed by one of the latter two methods? One possibil ity would be to have the frame\\ncall a method in the applet to tell the applet that it is closin g, but that would tightly couple\\nthe frame class to the applet class. In fact, it’s done with WindowEvents. A WindowListener in\\nthe applet listens for close events from the frame. In respon se to a close event, the text of the\\nbutton is changed. Again, this can happen even though the fra me class knows nothing about\\nthe applet class. Window events are also used by Main.java to trigger an action that has to be\\ntaken when the program is ending; this will be discussed belo w.\\nPerhaps the most interesting use of events in the Mandelbrot Viewer program is to enable\\nand disable menu commands based on the status of the display . F or this, events of type Prop-\\nertyChangeEvent are used. This event class is part of the “bean” framework tha t was discussed\\nbrieﬂy in Subsection 11.6.2, and class PropertyChangeEvent and related classes are deﬁned in'),\n",

ADV ANCED GUI PROGRAMMING\\nthe package java.beans. The idea is that bean objects are deﬁned by their “propertie s” (which\\nare just aspects of the state of the bean). When a bean propert y changes, the bean can emit\\na PropertyChangeEvent to notify other objects of the change. Properties for which p roperty\\nchange events are emitted are known technically as bound properties . A bound property has\\na name that identiﬁes that particular property among all the prope rties of the bean. When\\na property change event is generated, the event object inclu des the name of the property that\\nhas changed, the previous value of the property , and the new v alue of the property .\\nThe MandelbrotDisplay class has a bound property whose name is given by the constant\\nMandelbrotDisplay.STATUS PROPERTY. A display emits a property change event when its sta-\\ntus changes. The possible values of the status property are g iven by other constants, such\\nas MandelbrotDisplay.STATUS READY. The READY status indicates that the display is not cur-\\nrently running a computation and is ready to do another one. T here are several menu commands\\nthat should be enabled only when the status of the display is READY. T o implement this, the\\nMenus class deﬁnes a PropertyChangeListener to listen for property change events from the dis-\\nplay . When this listener hears an event, it responds by enabl ing or disabling menu commands\\naccording to the new value of the status property .\\nAll of Java’s GUI components are beans and are capable of emit ting property change events.\\nIn any subclass of Component, this can be done simply by calling the method\\npublic void firePropertyChange(String propertyName,\\nObject oldValue, Object newValue)\\nF or example, the MandelbrotDisplay class uses the following method for setting its current stat us:\\nprivate void setStatus(String status) {\\nif (status == this.status) {\\n// Note: Event should be fired only if status actually changes.\\nreturn;\\n}\\nString oldStatus = this.status;\\nthis.status = status;\\nfirePropertyChange(STATUS\\nPROPERTY, oldStatus, status);\\n}\\nWhen writing bean classes from scratch, you have to add suppo rt for property change events,\\nif you need them. T o make this easier, the java.beans package provides the PropertyChange-\\nSupport class.\\n12.5.5 Custom Dialogs\\nJava has several standard dialog boxes that are deﬁned in the classes JOptionPane, JColor-\\nChooser, and JFileChooser. These were introduced in Subsection 6.8.2 and Subsection 1 1.2.3.\\nDialogs of all these types are used in the Mandelbrot Viewer p rogram. However, sometimes\\nother types of dialog are needed. In such cases, you can build a custom dialog box.\\nDialog boxes are deﬁned by subclasses of the class JDialog. Like frames, dialog boxes are\\nseparate windows on the screen, and the JDialog class is very similar to the JFrame class. The\\nbig diﬀerence is that a dialog box has a parent, which is a frame or another dialog box that\\n“owns” the dialog box. If the parent of a dialog box closes, th e dialog box closes automatically .\\nF urthermore, the dialog box will probably “ﬂoat” on top of it s parent, even when its parent is\\nthe active window.'),\n",

FINISHING TOUCHES 669\\nDialog boxes can be either modal or modeless. When a modal dialog is put up on the\\nscreen, the rest of the application is blocked until the dial og box is dismissed. This is the most\\ncommon case, and all the standard dialog boxes are modal. Mod eless dialog boxes are more\\nlike independent windows, since they can stay on the screen w hile the user interacts with other\\nwindows. There are no modeless dialogs in the Mandelbrot Vie wer program.\\nThe Mandelbrot Viewer program uses two custom dialog boxes. They are used to implement\\nthe “Set Image Size” and “Set Limits” commands and are deﬁned by the ﬁles SetImageSizeDi-\\nalog.java and SetLimitsDialog.java. The “set image size” dialog lets the user enter a new width\\nand height for the Mandelbrot image. The “set limits” dialog lets the user input the minimum\\nand maximum values for x and y that are shown in the image. The t wo dialog classes are very\\nsimilar. In both classes, several JT extFields are used for user input. Two buttons named “OK”\\nand “Cancel” are added to the window, and listeners are set up for these buttons. If the user\\nclicks “OK”, the listener checks whether the inputs in the te xt ﬁelds are legal; if not, an error\\nmessage is displayed to the user and the dialog stays on the sc reen. If the input is legal when the\\nuser clicks “OK”, the dialog is disposed. The dialog is also d isposed if the user clicks “Cancel”\\nor clicks the dialog box’s close box. The net eﬀect is that the dialog box stays on the screen\\nuntil the user either cancels the dialog or enters legal valu es for the inputs and clicks “OK”.\\nThe user can ﬁnd out which of these occurred by calling a metho d named getInput() in the\\ndialog object after showing the dialog. This method returns null if the dialog was canceled;\\notherwise it returns the user input.\\nT o make my custom dialog boxes easy to use, I added a static showDialog() method to\\neach dialog class. When this function is called, it shows the dialog, waits for it to be dismissed,\\nand then returns the value of the getInput() method. This makes it possible to use my custom\\ndialog boxes in much the same way as Java’s standard dialog bo xes are used.\\nCustom dialog boxes are not diﬃcult to create and to use, if yo u already know about frames.\\nI will not discuss them further here, but you can look at the so urce code ﬁle SetImageSizeDia-\\nlog.java as a model.\\n12.5.6 Preferences\\nMost serious programs allow the user to set preferences. A preference is really just a piece of\\nthe program’s state that is saved between runs of the program . In order to make preferences\\npersistent from one run of the program to the next, the prefer ences could simply be saved to a\\nﬁle in the user’s home directory . However, there would then b e the problem of locating the ﬁle.\\nThere would be the problem of naming the ﬁle in a way that avoid s conﬂicts with ﬁle names\\nused by other programs. And there would be the problem of clut tering up the user’s home\\ndirectory with ﬁles that the user shouldn’t even have to know about.\\nT o deal with these problems, Java has a standard means of hand ling preferences. It is\\ndeﬁned by the package java.util.prefs. In general, the only thing that you need from this\\npackage is Preferences.\\nIn the Mandelbrot Viewer program, the ﬁle Main.java has an example of using Preferences.\\nMain.java runs the stand-alone application version of the program, an d its use of preferences\\napplies only when the program is run in that way .\\nIn most programs, the user sets preferences in a custom dialo g box. However, the Man-\\ndelbrot program doesn’t have any preferences that are appro priate for that type of treatment.\\nInstead, as an example, I automatically save a few aspects of the program’s state as preferences.\\nEvery time the program starts up, it reads the preferences, i f any are available. Every time\\nthe program terminates, it saves the preferences. (Saving t he preferences poses an interesting'),\n",

ADV ANCED GUI PROGRAMMING\\nproblem because the program ends when the MandelbrotFrame window closes, not when the\\nmain() routine ends. In fact, the main() routine ends as soon as the window appears on the\\nscreen. So, it won’t work to save the preferences at the end of the main program. The solution\\nis to use events: A listener listens for WindowEvents from the frame. When a window-closed\\nevent is received, indicating that the program is ending, th e listener saves the preferences.)\\nPreferences for Java programs are stored in some platform-d ependent form in some platform-\\ndependent location. As a Java programmer, you don’t have to w orry about it; the Java pref-\\nerences system knows where to store the data. There is still t he problem of identifying the\\npreferences for one program among all the possible Java prog rams that might be running on a\\ncomputer. Java solves this problem in the same way that it sol ves the package naming prob-\\nlem. In fact, by convention, the preferences for a program ar e identiﬁed by the package name of\\nthe program, with a slight change in notation. F or example, t he Mandelbrot Viewer program\\nis deﬁned in the package edu.hws.eck.mdb, and its preferences are identiﬁed by the string\\n“/edu/hws/eck/mdb”. (The periods have been changed to “ /”, and an extra “ /” has been\\nadded at the beginning.)\\nThe preferences for a program are stored in something called a “node.” The user preferences\\nnode for a given program identiﬁer can be accessed as follows :\\nPreferences root = Preferences.userRoot();\\nPreferences node = root.node(pathName);\\nwhere pathname is the string, such as “/edu/hws/eck/mdb”, that identiﬁes t he node. The\\nnode itself consists of a simple list of key/value pairs, whe re both the key and the value are\\nstrings. Y ou can store any strings you want in preferences no des—they are really just a way of\\nstoring some persistent data between program runs. In gener al, though, the key string identiﬁes\\nsome particular preference item, and the associated value s tring is the value of that preference.\\nA Preferences object, node, contains methods node.get(key) for retrieving the value string\\nassociated with a given key and node.put(key,value) for setting the value string for a given\\nkey .\\nIn Main.java, I use preferences to store the shape and position of the prog ram’s window.\\nThis makes the size and shape of the window persistent betwee n runs of the program; when\\nyou run the program, the window will be right where you left it the last time you ran it. I also\\nstore the name of the directory that is currently selected in the ﬁle dialog box that is used by\\nthe program for the Save and Open commands. This is particula rly satisfying, since the default\\nbehavior for a ﬁle dialog box is to start in the user’s home dir ectory , which is hardly ever the\\nplace where the user wants to keep a program’s ﬁles. With the p references feature, I can switch\\nto the right directory the ﬁrst time I use the program, and fro m then on I’ll automatically be\\nback in that directory when I use the program. Y ou can look at t he source code in Main.java\\nfor the details.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nAnd that’s it. . . . There’s a lot more that I could say about Jav a and about programming\\nin general, but this book is only “An Introduction to Program ming with Java,” and it’s time\\nfor our journey to end. I hope that it has been a pleasant journ ey for you, and I hope that I\\nhave helped you establish a foundation that you can use as a ba sis for further exploration.'),\n",

The sample program PaintWithOﬀScreenCanvas.java from Section 12.1 is a simple paint\\nprogram. Make two improvements to this program: First, add a “File” menu that lets\\nthe user open an image ﬁle and save the current image in either PNG or JPEG format.\\nSecond, add a basic one-level “Undo” command that lets the us er undo the most recent\\noperation that was applied to the image. (Do not try to make a m ultilevel Undo, which\\nwould allow the user to undo several operations.)\\nWhen you read a ﬁle into the program, you should copy the image that you read into\\nthe program’s oﬀ-screen canvas. Since the canvas in the prog ram has a ﬁxed size, you\\nshould scale the image that you read so that it exactly ﬁlls th e canvas.\\n2. F or this exercise, you should continue to work on the program from the previous exercise.\\nAdd a “StrokeWidth” menu that allows the user to draw lines of varying thicknesses.\\nMake it possible to use diﬀerent colors for the interior of a ﬁ lled shape and for the outline\\nof that shape. T o do this, change the “Color” menu to “StrokeC olor” and add a “Fill-\\nColor” menu. (My solution adds two new tools, “Stroked Fille d Rectangle” and “Stroked\\nFilled Oval”, to represent ﬁlled shapes that are outlined wi th the current stroke.) Add\\nsupport for ﬁlling shapes with transparent color. A simple a pproach to this is to use a\\nJCheckboxMenuItem to select either fully opaque or 50% opaque ﬁll. (Don’t try to apply\\ntransparency to stokes—it’s diﬃcult to make transparency w ork correctly for the Curve\\ntool, and in any case, shape outlines look better if they are o paque.) Finally , make the\\nmenus more user friendly by adding some keyboard accelerato rs to some commands and\\nby using JRadioButtonMenuItems where appropriate, such as in the color and tool menus.\\nThis exercise takes quite a bit of work to get it all right, so y ou should tackle the problem\\nin pieces.\\n3. The StopWatchLabel component from Subsection 12.4.5 displays the text “Timing . . . ”\\nwhen the stop watch is running. It would be nice if it displaye d the elapsed time since\\nthe stop watch was started. F or that, you need to create a Timer. (See Subsection 6.5.1.)\\nAdd a Timer to the original source code, StopWatchLabel.java, to drive the display of the\\nelapsed time in seconds. Create the timer in the mousePressed() routine when the stop\\nwatch is started. Stop the timer in the mousePressed() routine when the stop watch\\nis stopped. The elapsed time won’t be very accurate anyway , s o just show the integral\\nnumber of seconds. Y ou only need to set the text a few times per second. F or my Timer\\nmethod, I use a delay of 200 milliseconds for the timer.\\n4. The custom component example MirrorText.java, from Subsection 12.4.5, uses an oﬀ-\\nscreen canvas to show mirror-reversed text in a JPanel. An alternative approach would\\nbe to draw the text after applying a transform to the graphics context that is used for\\ndrawing. (See Subsection 12.2.5.) With this approach, the c ustom component can be\\ndeﬁned as a subclass of JLabel in which the paintComponent() method is overridden.\\nW rite a version of the MirrorText component that takes this approach. The solution is\\nvery short, but tricky . Note that the scale transform g2.scale(-1,1) does a left-right\\nreﬂection through the left edge of the component.\\n5. The sample program PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java from Subsection 11.3.2 keeps data for\\na “phone directory” in a ﬁle in the user’s home directory . Exe rcise 11.5 asked you to'),\n",

ADV ANCED GUI PROGRAMMING\\nrevise that program to use an XML format for the data. Both pro grams have a simple\\ncommand-line user interface. F or this exercise, you should provide a GUI interface for the\\nphone directory data. Y ou can base your program either on the original sample program\\nor on the modiﬁed version from the exercise. Use a JT able to hold the data. The user\\nshould be able to edit all the entries in the table. Also, the u ser should be able to add and\\ndelete rows. Include either buttons or menu commands that ca n be used to perform these\\nactions. The delete command should delete the selected row, if any . New rows should be\\nadded at the end of the table. F or this program, you can use a st andard DefaultT ableModel.\\nY our program should load data from the ﬁle when it starts and s ave data to the ﬁle\\nwhen it ends, just as the two previous programs do. F or a GUI pr ogram, you can’t simply\\nsave the data at the end of the main() routine, since main() terminates as soon as the\\nwindow shows up on the screen. Y ou want to save the data when th e user closes the window\\nand ends the program. There are several approaches. One is to use a WindowListener to\\ndetect the event that occurs when the window closes. Another is to use a “Quit” command\\nto end the program; when the user quits, you can save the data a nd close the window (by\\ncalling its dispose() method), and end the program. If you use the “Quit” command\\napproach, you don’t want the user to be able to end the program simply by closing the\\nwindow. T o accomplish this, you should call\\nframe.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DO NOTHING ON CLOSE);\\nwhere frame refers to the JFrame that you have created for the program’s user interface.\\nWhen using a WindowListener, you want the close box on the window to close the window,\\nnot end the program. F or this, you need\\nframe.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE ON CLOSE);\\nWhen the listener is notiﬁed of a window closed event, it can s ave the data and end the\\nprogram.\\nMost of the JT able and DefaultT ableModel methods that you need for this exercise are\\ndiscussed in Subsection 12.4.3, but there are a few more that you need to know about. T o\\ndetermine which row is selected in a JT able, call table.getSelectedRow(). This method\\nreturns the row number of the selected row, or returns -1 if no row is selected. T o specify\\nwhich cell is currently being edited, you can use:\\ntable.setRowSelectionInterval(rowNum, rowNum); // Sele cts row number rowNum.\\ntable.editCellAt( rowNum, colNum ); // Edit cell at position (rowNum,colNum).\\nphoneTable.getEditorComponent().requestFocus(); // Pu t input cursor in cell.\\nOne particularly troublesome point is that the data that is i n the cell that is currently\\nbeing edited is not in the table model. The value in the edit ce ll is not put into the table\\nmodel until after the editing is ﬁnished. This means that eve n though the user sees the\\ndata in the cell, its not really part of the table data yet. If y ou lose that data, the user\\nwould be justiﬁed in complaining. T o make sure that you get th e right data when you\\nsave the data at the end of the program, you have to turn oﬀ edit ing before retrieving the\\ndata from the model. This can be done with the following metho d:\\nprivate void stopEditing() {\\nif (table.getCellEditor() != null)\\ntable.getCellEditor().stopCellEditing();\\n}\\nThis method must also be called before modifying the table by adding or deleting rows; if\\nsuch modiﬁcations are made while editing is in progress, the eﬀect can be very strange.'),\n",

The ﬁles listed here are those which are\\ngeneral enough to be potentially useful in other programmin g projects. All of them are also\\nreferred to above, along with the programming examples that depend on them.\\n• TextIO.java deﬁnes a class containing some static methods for doing inpu t/output. These\\nmethods make it easier to use the standard input and output st reams, System.in and\\nSystem.out. T extIO also supports other input sources and output destinations, such\\nas ﬁles. Note that this version of T extIO is new with the ﬁfth edition of this textbook\\nand requires Java 5.0 (or higher). The T extIO class deﬁned by this ﬁle will be useless\\non a system that does not implement standard input, and might be inconvenient to use\\nin integrated development environments such as Eclipse in w hich standard input works\\npoorly . In that case, you might want to use the following ﬁle i nstead.\\n• TextIO.java for GUI deﬁnes an alternative to the preceding ﬁle. It deﬁnes a versi on of\\nT extIO with the same set of input and output routines as the original version. But instead\\nof using standard I/O, this GUI version opens its own window, and the input/output is\\ndone in that window. Please read the comments at the beginnin g of the ﬁle. (F or people\\nwho have downloaded this book: The ﬁle is located in a directo ry named T extIO-GUI\\ninside the source directory .)\\n• TextIOApplet.java can be used for writing applets that simulate T extIO applets. This\\nmakes it possible to write applets that use “console-style” input/output. Such applets are\\ncreated as subclasses of T extIOApplet. See the comments in the ﬁle for more information\\nabout how to convert a T extIO program into a T extIOApplet app let. An example can be\\nfound in the ﬁle Interest3Console.java.\\n• TextReader.java can be used to “wrap” an input stream in an object that makes it easy\\nto read data from the stream. A T extReader object has basically the same input methods\\nas the T extIO class. The T extReader class is introduced in Subsection 11.1.4\\n• SimpleAnimationApplet2.java, a class that can be used as a framework for writing ani-\\nmated applets. T o use the framework, you have to deﬁne a subcl ass of SimpleAnimation-\\nApplet2. Section 3.8 has an example.\\n• Mosaic.java contains subroutines for opening and controlling a window t hat contains a\\ngrid of colored rectangles. It depends on MosaicCanvas.java. This is a toolbox for writing\\nsimple stand-alone applications that use a “mosaic window” . This is rather old code, but\\nit is used in examples in Section 4.6 and Section 4.7.\\n• MosaicPanel.java is a greatly improved version of MosaicCanvas.java that has many op-\\ntions. This class deﬁnes a subclass of JPanel that shows litt le rectangles arranged in rows\\nand columns. It is used in the “mosaic draw” example in Sectio n 6.8.\\n• Expr.java deﬁnes a class Expr that represent mathematical expressions involving the var i-\\nable x. It is used in some of the exercises in Chapter 8.\\n• I18n.java is a class that can be used to help in internationalization of a program. See\\nSubsection 12.5.3.

Example libraries that\\nprovide access to online streaming services includeSpotipy(https://openstax.org/r/100spotipy),Pytube\\n(https://openstax.org/r/100pytube), andPydora(https://openstax.org/r/100pydora). Python-related tools\\noften have the letters \"py\" in their name.\\nThe Python language\\nThis book introducesPython(https://openstax.org/r/100python), one of the top programming languages\\ntoday. Leading tech giants like Google, Apple, NASA, Instagram, Pixar, and others use Python extensively.\\nOne reason why Python is popular is because many libraries exist for doing real work. Alibraryis a collection\\nof code that can be used in other programs. Python comes with an extensiveStandard Library\\n(https://openstax.org/r/100pythlibrary)for solving everyday computing problems like extracting data from files\\nand creating summary reports. In addition, the community develops many other libraries for Python. Ex:\\nPandas(https://openstax.org/r/100pandas)is a widely used library for data analysis.\\nAnother reason why Python is popular is because the syntax is concise and straightforward. Thesyntaxof a\\nlanguage defines how code must be structured. Syntax rules define the keywords, symbols, and formatting\\nused in programs. Compared to other programming languages, Python is more concise and straightforward.\\nEXAMPLE1.1\\nHello world in Python and Java\\nBy tradition,Hello World(https://openstax.org/r/100helloworld)is the first program to write when learning\\na new language. This program simply displays the message\"Hello, World!\"to the user. The hello world\\nprogram is only one line in Python:\\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\\nIn contrast, the hello world program is five lines in Java (a different language).\\npublic class Hello {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\\n}\\n}\\nHowever, conciseness is not the only consideration for which language is used. In different situations\\ndifferent languages may be more appropriate.

Even experienced programmers make mistakes when\\nwriting code. Errors may result when mistakes are made when writing code. The computer requires very\\nspecific instructions telling the computer what to do. If the instructions are not clear, then the computer does\\nnot know what to do and gives back an error.\\nWhen an error occurs, Python displays a message with the following information:\\n1. The line number of the error.\\n2. The type of error (Ex:SyntaxError).\\n3. Additional details about the error.\\nEx: Typingprint \"Hello!\"without parentheses is a syntax error. In Python, parentheses are required to use\\nprint. When attempting to runprint \"Hello!\", Python displays the following error:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"/home/student/Desktop/example.py\", line 1\\nprint \"Hello\"\\n^\\nSyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to \\'print\\'. Did you mean print(\"Hello\")?\\nThe caret character (^) shows where Python found the error. Sometimes the error may be located one or two\\nlines before where the caret symbol is shown because Python may not have discovered the error until then.\\nTracebackis a Python report of the location and type of error.

In 1982,Guido van Rossum(https://openstax.org/r/100vanRossum), the\\ncreator of Python, started working atCWI(https://openstax.org/r/100CWI), a Dutch national research institute.\\nHe joined a team that was designing a new programming language, named ABC, for teaching and prototyping.\\nABC\\'s simplicity was ideal for beginners, but the language lacked features required to write advanced\\nprograms.\\nSeveral years later, van Rossum joined a different team at CWI working on an operating system. The team\\nneeded an easier way to write programs for monitoring computers and analyzing data. Languages common in\\nthe 1980\\'s were (and still are) difficult to use for these kinds of programs. van Rossum envisioned a new\\nlanguage that would have a simple syntax, like ABC, but also provide advanced features that professionals\\nwould need.\\nAt first, van Rossum started working on this new language as a hobby during his free time. He named the\\nlanguage Python because he was a fan of the British comedy groupMonty Python(https://openstax.org/r/\\n100MontyPython). Over the next year, he and his colleagues successfully used Python many times for real\\nwork. van Rossum eventually decided to share Python with the broader programming community online. He\\nfreely shared Python\\'s entire source code so that anyone could write and run Python programs.\\nPython\\'s first release, known as Version 0.9.0, appeared in 1991, about six years after C++ and four years\\nbefore Java. van Rossum\\'s decisions to make the language simple yet advanced, suitable for everyday tasks,\\nand freely available online contributed to Python\\'s long-term success.\\nCHECKPOINT\\nKey decisions\\nAccess multimedia content(https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/1-8-why-\\npython)\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nPython history\\n1.

Millions of\\nprogrammers around the world use Python for all kinds of interesting projects. Hundreds of thousands of\\nPython libraries have been released as open source software. The Python community is very active and\\nsupportive online, answering questions and sharing code.\\nOne way to see Python\\'s popularity is theTIOBE index(https://openstax.org/r/100TIOBE). TIOBE is a Dutch\\ncompany that provides products and services for measuring software code quality. Since 2001, TIOBE has\\ntracked the popularity of programming languages and posted the results online.Figure 1.2shows the TIOBE\\nindex over time for five of the most popular languages.\\nThe TIOBE index is based on the number of search engine results for each language. The percentage refers to\\nhow many results belong to that language. Python has been among the top 10 languages every year since\\n2004. In October 2021, Python became the #1 language on the TIOBE index. No other language but C and Java\\nhad been #1 for the previous 20 years.\\nAnother way to see Python\\'s popularity is to analyze how frequently Python is discussed online.Stack Overflow\\n(https://openstax.org/r/100overflow)is a question-and-answer website for programmers.Figure 1.3shows the\\nnumber of questions asked each month that were tagged with Python, JavaScript, and so forth.

Programs\\nwritten in high-level languages must be translated into machine code to run. This translation process can\\nhappen all at once, or a little at a time, depending on the language.\\nPython is an interpreted language: the source code is translated one line at a time while the program is\\nrunning. The Pythoninterpretertranslates source code into machine code and runs the resulting program. If\\nand when an error occurs, the interpreter stops translating the source code and displays an error message.\\nMost development environments include a Python shell for experimenting with code interactively. Ashell, also\\ncalled a console or terminal, is a program that allows direct interaction with an interpreter. The interpreter\\nusually runs an entire program all at once. But the interpreter can run one line of code at a time within a\\nPython shell.\\nCHECKPOINT\\nRunning a Python shell\\nAccess multimedia content(https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/2-1-the-\\npython-shell)\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nUsing a Python shell\\n1.

A string is made up of a sequence of characters indexed from left to right,\\nstarting at 0. For a string variables, the left-most character is indexed 0 and the right-most character is\\nindexedlen(s) - 1. Ex: The length of the string\"Cloud\"is 5, so the last index is 4.\\nNegative indexing can also be used to refer to characters from right to left starting at -1. For a string variable\\ns, the left-most character is indexed-len(s)and the right-most character is indexed -1. Ex: The length of the\\nstring\"flower\"is 6, so the index of the first character with negative indexing is -6.\\n200 8 • Strings\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The base case stops the recursion. A\\nrecursive algorithm must include a base case; otherwise, the algorithm may result in an infinite computation.\\nTo calculate a factorial, a recursive function,factorial()is defined with an integer input parameter,n. When\\nn > 1, the recursive case applies. Thefactorial()calls itself with a smaller argument,n - 1. Whenn ==\\n1, the solution is known because1!is1; therefore,n == 1is a base case.\\nNote:0!is defined to be1; therefore,n == 0is a second base case forfactorial(). Whenn < 1, an error\\nis returned.\\nCHECKPOINT\\nFactorial using recursion\\nAccess multimedia content(https://openstax.org/books/introduction-python-programming/pages/\\n12-2-simple-math-recursion)\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nProgramming recursion\\nFor the questions below, the functionrec_fact()is another recursive function that calculates a factorial.\\nWhat is the result of each definition ofrec_fact()ifn = 17is the initial input parameter?\\n5. def rec_fact(n):\\nreturn n * rec_fact(n - 1)\\na. 355687428096000\\nb. 0\\nc. no result / infinite computation\\n6. def rec_fact(n):\\nif n < 0:\\nprint(\"error\")\\n290 12 • Recursion\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

When the computer\\nexecutes a variable declaration, it sets aside memory for th e variable and associates the variable’s\\nname with that memory . A simple variable declaration takes t he form:\\n⟨type-name ⟩ ⟨ variable-name-or-names ⟩;\\nThe ⟨variable-name-or-names⟩ can be a single variable name or a list of variable names\\nseparated by commas. (W e’ll see later that variable declara tion statements can actually be\\nsomewhat more complicated than this.) Good programming sty le is to declare only one variable\\nin a declaration statement, unless the variables are closel y related in some way . F or example:\\nint numberOfStudents;\\nString name;\\ndouble x, y;\\nboolean isFinished;\\nchar firstInitial, middleInitial, lastInitial;'),\n",

OBJECTS AND SUBROUTINES 29\\n2.3.1 Built-in Subroutines and F unctions\\nRecall that a subroutine is a set of program instructions tha t have been chunked together and\\ngiven a name. In Chapter 4, you’ll learn how to write your own s ubroutines, but you can\\nget a lot done in a program just by calling subroutines that ha ve already been written for\\nyou. In Java, every subroutine is contained in a class or in an object. Some classes that are\\nstandard parts of the Java language contain predeﬁned subro utines that you can use. A value\\nof type String, which is an object, contains subroutines that can be used to manipulate that\\nstring. These subroutines are “built into” the Java languag e. Y ou can call all these subroutines\\nwithout understanding how they were written or how they work . Indeed, that’s the whole point\\nof subroutines: A subroutine is a “black box” which can be use d without knowing what goes\\non inside.'),\n",

Y ou’ve seen one example: In a class that deﬁnes a\\nprogram, the main() routine is a static member of the class. The parts of a class de ﬁnition that\\ndeﬁne static members are marked with the reserved word “ static”, just like the main() routine\\nof a program. However, classes have a second function.

OBJECTS AND CLASSES\\nSuch multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java. The designers of Java wanted to keep the\\nlanguage reasonably simple, and felt that the beneﬁts of mul tiple inheritance were not worth the\\ncost in increased complexity . However, Java does have a feat ure that can be used to accomplish\\nmany of the same goals as multiple inheritance: interfaces.\\nW e’ve encountered the term “interface” before, in connecti on with black boxes in general and\\nsubroutines in particular. The interface of a subroutine co nsists of the name of the subroutine,\\nits return type, and the number and types of its parameters. T his is the information you need\\nto know if you want to call the subroutine. A subroutine also h as an implementation: the block\\nof code which deﬁnes it and which is executed when the subrout ine is called.\\nIn Java, interface is a reserved word with an additional, technical meaning.

An\\n“ interface” in this sense consists of a set of instance method interface s, without any as-\\nsociated implementations. (Actually , a Java interface can contain other things as well, but we\\nwon’t discuss them here.) A class can implement an interface by providing an implemen-\\ntation for each of the methods speciﬁed by the interface. Her e is an example of a very simple\\nJava interface:\\npublic interface Drawable {\\npublic void draw(Graphics g);\\n}\\nThis looks much like a class deﬁnition, except that the imple mentation of the draw() method is\\nomitted.

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nother. A GUI program oﬀers a much richer type of user interfac e, where the user uses a mouse\\nand keyboard to interact with GUI components such as windows , menus, buttons, check boxes,\\ntext input boxes, scroll bars, and so on. The main routine of a GUI program creates one or\\nmore such components and displays them on the computer scree n. V ery often, that’s all it does.\\nOnce a GUI component has been created, it follows its own programming—programming that\\ntells it how to draw itself on the screen and how to respond to e vents such as being clicked on\\nby the user.\\nA GUI program doesn’t have to be immensely complex. W e can, fo r example, write a very\\nsimple GUI “Hello W orld” program that says “Hello” to the use r, but does it by opening a\\nwindow where the the greeting is displayed:\\nimport javax.swing.JOptionPane;\\npublic class HelloWorldGUI1 {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nJOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null, \"Hello World!\" );\\n}'),\n",

The window also contains an “OK” button for t he user to click after reading\\nthe message. When the user clicks this button, the window clo ses and the program ends. By\\nthe way , this program can be placed in a ﬁle named HelloWorldGUI1.java, compiled, and run\\njust like any other Java program.\\nNow, this program is already doing some pretty fancy stuﬀ.

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\n6.1.3 Events and Listeners\\nThe structure of containers and components sets up the physi cal appearance of a GUI, but\\nit doesn’t say anything about how the GUI behaves. That is, what can the user do to the\\nGUI and how will it respond? GUIs are largely event-driven; that is, the program waits\\nfor events that are generated by the user’s actions (or by som e other cause). When an event\\noccurs, the program responds by executing an event-handling method . In order to program\\nthe behavior of a GUI, you have to write event-handling metho ds to respond to the events that\\nyou are interested in.\\nThe most common technique for handling events in Java is to us e event listeners . A\\nlistener is an object that includes one or more event-handli ng methods. When an event is\\ndetected by another object, such as a button or menu, the list ener object is notiﬁed and it\\nresponds by running the appropriate event-handling method . An event is detected or generated'),\n",

Another object, the listener, has the responsi bility of responding to the event.\\nThe event itself is actually represented by a third object, w hich carries information about the\\ntype of event, when it occurred, and so on. This division of re sponsibilities makes it easier to\\norganize large programs.\\nAs an example, consider the OK button in the sample program. W hen the user clicks the\\nbutton, an event is generated. This event is represented by a n object belonging to the class\\nActionEvent.

This example is very similar to the stand-a lone application HelloWorldGUI2\\nfrom the previous section. It uses an event-handling class t o respond when the user clicks the\\nbutton, a panel to display the message, and another panel tha t serves as a container for the\\nmessage panel and the button.
